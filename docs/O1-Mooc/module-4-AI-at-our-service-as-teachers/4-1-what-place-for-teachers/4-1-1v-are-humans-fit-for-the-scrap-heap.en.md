# 4.1.1 Video: What place for human beings?

This video highlights the anticipated changes due to AI in work (and in particular the evolution of certain professions) without specifically addressing the field of education.  
The question of "Human in the loop" - i.e. what place should be given to the human being in decision support systems - is raised.
This humorous video can be used in the classroom.  

**Do you also have questions?**

####Synopsis
The main character, _Guillaume_, calls the hotline after reading an article about the possible disappearance of many jobs, whose work would in the future be done by AIs. He mentions projections that, in 10 or 20 years, foresee the disappearance of many jobs, especially white-collar jobs, whose tasks could be automated. _The Hotline_ puts this evolution into perspective and makes the link with the transformations that occurred in the 19th century during the industrial revolution. She recalls that all innovation leads to the replacement of certain activities by others. She also emphasises that today it is not really possible to know exactly which jobs will be automated.
The discussion between _Guillaume_ and _The Hotline_ then refocuses on a new question: not what activities can be performed by AIs but what decisions should or should not be made by them.
