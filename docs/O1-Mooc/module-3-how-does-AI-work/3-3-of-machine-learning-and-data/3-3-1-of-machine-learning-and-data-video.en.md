When we talk about AI today, we most often hear "machine learning". But how do machines learn, and what do they learn from?

**Explanation**  
_Watch the video below (9'35")_

####Synopsis
The video presents the different approaches to learning. On the one hand the symbolic approach and on the other hand the numerical approach.
The video then describes machine learning with its two main modes of operation: supervised learning and reinforcement learning. Deep learning (or deep neural network) is then discussed, which is one of the modalities of machine learning and is inspired by the functioning of the brain.
In addition to the algorithms, which were mentioned at the beginning of the video, _Guillaume_ reminds us of the importance of data. Because these data must be numerous, and correctly labelled, to allow AIs to learn correctly, and to make satisfactory predictions. This is an opportunity to come back to the "manufacture" of data and its challenges.
In its last part, the video finally discusses the environmental impact of AI.
