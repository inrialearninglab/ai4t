# Explore and support the use of AI in education

AI applications and technologies are now an integral part of our daily lives. They are also making their way into education, with automatic text translation and dialogue with an educational chatbot, for example. The aim of this portal is to help the education community as a whole and everyone else to acquire a general understanding of AI, and to develop an informed use of AI-based tools in the context of education.  
Each resource is made available as a free, open source, multilingual resource, for free re-use and adaptation of its content in all languages.

The resources are organised into 3 parts:

- üéì the **Mooc**,  
an online training for teachers whose content and activities identify the potential and current uses of AI in education, understand what AI really is and where it comes from, experiment with different AI techniques, identify the crucial role of data for AI-based educational tools, and apply a methodology for analysing an AI-based educational tool.

- üéÅ the **Resources**,  
a set of complementary resources and tools related to AI or AI and education, used during the experimentation phase of the European AI4T project.  
‚úÖ [Explore some AI Tools for Education, and learn more about AI](https://inrialearninglab.github.io/ai4t//2-Project-resources/0-presentation/0-1-presentation-AI4T-resources.html)

- üß∞ the **Build Your Own Training** section,  
the methodology designed to implement the Mooc on various e-learning platforms and help those who wish to reuse the resources of the Mooc, translate them and organise them to build their own AI training course.  
‚úÖ [Reuse, reorganise, improve, translate and share AI4T teaching resources](https://inrialearninglab.github.io/ai4t//3-Build-your-own-training/3-0-Intro-The-forge/3-0-1-Map-Build-your-own-training.html)

*This course has been developed, tested and evaluated in 5 European countries (France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg and Slovenia) as part of the European Erasmus+ [project AI4T](https://www.ai4t.eu/). A cooperation that involved 17 members (ministries, universities, training operators ‚Ä¶) to contribute to training on AI in education for and by teachers and school leaders on a perimeter voluntarily restricted to mathematics, science and modern English language in high school (pupils aged 15-16). A project officially launched on 28 February 2021 for an action that has been running for 36 months.*
