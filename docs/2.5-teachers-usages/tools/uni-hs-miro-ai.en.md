## Description[^1]

Miro is an artificial intelligence-based visual collaboration platform used for creating interactive whiteboards, brainstorming, project management and collaborative design.

## Features

- Interactive whiteboards: Create and collaborate on virtual whiteboards with drawing tools, post-it notes, diagrams, etc. suitable for collaborative activities.
- AI-assisted idea generation: Uses artificial intelligence to help structure ideas, generate creative proposals and guide users through their thought processes.
- Integrations with other tools: Compatible with tools such as Google Drive, Slack, Jira, and other collaboration platforms, making it easy to manage projects and share resources.

## Example of use[^2]

A university lecturer may ask their students to use Miro to create a brainstorming session for a group project in class. Students can collaborate on a virtual whiteboard, organise their ideas, add comments and links, all while being guided by intelligent AI suggestions. The lecturer monitors the progress of the project in real time and can intervene to guide students or rearrange priorities.

## Points to consider

- Premium subscription: Some advanced features require a paid subscription, although the basic version is free and offers many possibilities.
- Complexity for new users: Although the tool is intuitive, users new to project management or collaborative work may need some time to adapt to the features.
