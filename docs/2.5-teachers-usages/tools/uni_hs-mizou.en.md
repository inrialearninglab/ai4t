## Description[^1]

Mizou is a French platform designed to create personalized chatbots for learning and learning support.

## Features[^1]

* Grammar correction assistance: Mizou automatically detects and corrects grammatical errors in students’ written texts.
* Personalized explanations: When an error is detected, Mizou provides detailed explanations of the grammatical rule, helping the student understand the mistake.
* Progress tracking: Mizou offers personalized monitoring of each student’s progress, helping identify weaknesses and adapt study accordingly.

## Classroom use example[^2]

A French teacher uses Mizou as a grammar assistant for students. Every week, students write a composition at home. Once finished, they submit their text to Mizou for correction. The tool provides explanations of grammatical errors, helping students understand why a structure is incorrect and how to improve it.

## Practical tips[^2]

* Use for homework: Have students submit their work to Mizou before handing it in. This allows them to self-correct and strengthen their understanding of grammatical rules.
* Integrate results in class: Use recurring errors highlighted by Mizou to guide classroom revision by addressing common difficulties.
