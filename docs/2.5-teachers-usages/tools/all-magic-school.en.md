## Description[^1]

Magic School AI is an American platform dedicated to education. It integrates over 80 tools for teachers and more than 50 for students, including lesson planning, content creation, assessment, pedagogical differentiation, and AI literacy.

## Features[^1]

* Lesson planning: Quickly generate lesson plans aligned with curricula and learning objectives.
* Content creation: Develop quizzes, flashcards, summaries, video scripts, newsletters, and course materials.

## Use Case[^2]

Magic School has been experimented with by teachers for:

* Summarizing texts and adapting them to different levels,
* Creating quizzes and designing a video script on figures of speech,
* Generating revision flashcards for key terms,
* Producing summaries and multiple-choice questions in three languages (English, French, and Vietnamese) from course videos.

Among Magic School's tools, some have been tested[^3] and contextualized by a French teacher at INSPÉ Académie de Créteil.
