## Description[^1]

ResearchRabbit is a free New Zealand–based platform for academic literature discovery and monitoring. It allows users to explore academic works through similarity to a “seed” article, visualise networks of papers and co-authors, and build personalised reference collections.

## Features[^1]

- Create thematic collections from articles (title, DOI, URL) or via Zotero/RIS/BibTeX import.
- Explore by similarity, cited references, or citing articles.
- Automatic tracking of authors added to a collection, with alerts for their new publications.
- Share and collaborate on collections.
- Full integration with Zotero.

## Example[^2]

A university instructor teaches students how to structure their bibliographic research with this tool.
