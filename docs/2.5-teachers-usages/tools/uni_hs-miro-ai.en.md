## Description[^1]

Miro is a U.S.-based collaborative work platform powered by artificial intelligence. It is used for creating collaborative whiteboards, brainstorming, project management, and co-design.

## Features[^1]

- Interactive whiteboards: Create and collaborate on virtual whiteboards with drawing tools, sticky notes, diagrams, and more, suitable for collaborative activities.  
- AI-assisted idea generation: Uses artificial intelligence to help structure ideas, generate creative proposals, and support users in their thinking process.  
- Integrations with other tools: Compatible with tools such as Google Drive, Slack, Jira, and other collaboration platforms, facilitating project management and resource sharing.  

## Example of use[^2]

A university instructor may ask students to use Miro to run a brainstorming session for a group project. Students collaborate on a virtual whiteboard, organise their ideas, add comments and links, while benefiting from AI-generated suggestions. The instructor tracks the project’s progress in real time and may step in to guide students or reorganise priorities.

## Points to consider[^2]

- Premium subscription: Some advanced features require a paid subscription, although the free version already offers many possibilities.  
- Complexity for new users: While intuitive, the tool may require some adaptation time for users unfamiliar with project management or collaborative workflows.
