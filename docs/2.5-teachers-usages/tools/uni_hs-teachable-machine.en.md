## Description[^1]

Teachable Machine is a American web service (developed by Google) that allows you to train artificial intelligence (AI) models without needing to code or create an account. It uses machine learning to recognize images, sounds, or body poses.

## Features[^1]

* Image recognition: Identifies objects, facial expressions, or drawings.
* Sound recognition: Distinguishes specific noises or voice commands.
* Pose recognition: Analyzes body movements to detect different postures or gestures.

## Example of educational use[^2]

A science teacher asks students to train a model to recognize different plant species from photos taken during a field trip. The AI learns to distinguish leaf shapes, and students explore how automatic classification works.

## Practical tips

* Use varied examples to avoid bias in the AI.
* Check the model’s accuracy and adjust the training data if needed.
