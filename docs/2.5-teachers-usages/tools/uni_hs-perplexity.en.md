## Description[^1]

Perplexity is an American conversational search engine. It allows exploring and synthesizing information from various sources, including scientific articles, specialized databases, and online publications. The search engine provides its sources at the end of the query.

## Features[^1]

- Information synthesis: When a question is asked, the AI generates a summary of relevant information, providing a quick overview of a topic without navigating multiple pages.
- Multiple source integration: Perplexity aggregates data from different types of sources (scientific articles, blogs, books, specialized forums) to deliver a comprehensive and diverse answer.

## Use Case[^2]

A teacher uses Perplexity to search for recent data on the effects of climate change. The tool displays a summary of the most recent studies within seconds, including figures, results, and references from scientific journals and environmental institutions.

## Practical Tips[^2]

- Use Perplexity for preparatory research: Instead of starting with conventional search engines, use Perplexity to obtain precise and concise answers that guide you to better sources.
