### Zotero & EndNote (with integrated AI)
[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) & [EndNote](https://endnote.com/) are bibliographic management softwares enhanced with AI plugins.  
They can automatically extract metadata from web pages, PDFs, or DOIs to populate a reference library.  
*Use Example*: A student finds an article on Google Scholar, AI extracts its metadata, and adds it directly to Zotero.

### CrossRef Metadata Search
[CrossRef](https://www.crossref.org/) is a DOI database. AI-powered APIs[^2] enable automatic search and insertion of DOIs into articles or reference managers.  
*Use Example*: A student adds articles to their reference manager, and AI retrieves DOIs along with bibliographic information.

### Best Practices
- Always verify AI-extracted DOIs to avoid citation errors, especially for recent publications.  
- Use APIs like CrossRef to automate DOI management while ensuring reference consistency.


[^1]: DOI (Digital Object Identifier): a unique and permanent identifier for a digital document (article, report, etc.) to facilitate location and citation.  
[^2]: API (Application Programming Interface): a software interface that enables communication between programs to automate data exchange.
