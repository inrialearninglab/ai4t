## Enhancing Understanding with Easy-to-Read and Understand (FALC)

Principle:  
FALC (in french Facile à Lire et à Comprendre, in english easy to read and understand ) simplifies vocabulary, syntax, and text formatting to make content accessible to students with reading or comprehension difficulties or cognitive disabilities.  
AI can automate this reformulation while preserving the educational meaning.

Application example:  
A teacher can ask an AI to reformulate exercise instructions or project steps according to FALC principles, improving clarity and comprehension for all students.

## Diversifying Learning Materials

Principle:  
AI enables the delivery of content in multiple formats according to learner needs and preferences: text, image, audio, or video.  
This approach supports attention, autonomy, and equal access to information.

Application example:  
From a single lesson, an AI can generate an audio version for dyslexic students, a visual diagram for visual learners, or a simplified summary for students requiring comprehension support.

## Training and Supporting Teachers

Principle:  
The effectiveness of AI for inclusion also depends on teacher training and approach.  
It can be used for self-training, adjusting communication, or redesigning course materials inclusively.  
AI can also facilitate clearer, more considerate communication.

Application example:  
A teacher can use AI to reformulate a message for a student or family to make it more accessible, or to adapt an activity without disrupting group dynamics.
