## The A.C.T.I.V.E Method

* **A – Action**: specify what you expect from the AI.  
  *Example: generate a summary, analyze data.*

* **C – Context**: clearly define the context in which the AI operates.  
  *Example: for a classroom presentation, a research project.*

* **T – Task**: be explicit about the task to accomplish.  
  *Example: write a text on the evolution of biology, compare two scientific articles.*

* **I – Input**: provide the necessary information or data for the task.  
  *Example: here are the experiment data, here is a text excerpt to summarize.*

* **V – Version / Verification**: specify the desired output format or check it.  
  *Example: a table, a 300-word text, a comparative chart.*

* **E – Example / Explanation**: optionally give an example or clarify the style expected.
  *Example: highlight the key points in the summary.*

## Five steps to create an effective prompt [^1]

* **Initialize the conversation**: define your role and objective.  
  *Example: I am a French teacher and I want to create a lesson on Romanticism.*

* **Describe the task**: be clear and specific in the request.  
  *Example: I want you to generate a detailed lesson plan.*

* **Add constraints**: specify limits or conditions.  
  *Example: the lesson is for middle school students and must last 45 minutes.*

* **Specify output format**: indicate the expected form of the response.  
  *Example: provide a table with columns for objectives, activities, and assessments.*

* **Refine the response**: adjust the prompt by reformulating or adding details.  
  *Example: can you expand on the classroom activities and suggest resources for each section?*

## Practical prompt creation examples

### Example 1: Create a summary of a scientific article

* **Action**: summarize the article
* **Context**: for a presentation at a scientific conference
* **Task**: extract the main points
* **Input**: full article to summarize
* **Format**: approximately 300-word summary

**Prompt:**

> I am a biology researcher preparing a conference presentation. Please summarize the following article on the effects of climate change on biodiversity, extracting the main points. The summary should be around 300 words.

### Example 2: Create a personalized quiz for students

* **Action**: create a quiz
* **Context**: middle school mathematics class
* **Task**: generate 10 questions about fractions
* **Input**: list of student skills
* **Format**: multiple-choice questions with detailed answers

**Prompt:**

> I am a middle school mathematics teacher. I want to create a quiz on fractions for my students. Generate 10 multiple-choice questions with detailed answers for each. Adjust the difficulty to suit students from beginner to intermediate levels.
