title: Searching and Extracting DOIs with AI
description: Automate the search, extraction, and addition of DOIs
---
The tools below were mentioned by teachers on the AI4T forum for DOI extraction.

### Zotero & EndNote (with integrated AI)
Bibliographic management software enhanced with AI plugins can automatically extract metadata from web pages, PDFs, or DOIs to populate a reference library.  
*Example*: A student finds an article on Google Scholar, AI extracts its metadata, and adds it directly to Zotero.

### CrossRef Metadata Search
CrossRef is a DOI database. AI-powered APIs enable automatic search and insertion of DOIs into articles or reference managers.  
*Example*: A student adds articles to their reference manager, and AI retrieves DOIs along with bibliographic information.

### Best Practices
- Always verify AI-extracted DOIs to avoid citation errors, especially for recent publications.  
- Use APIs like CrossRef to automate DOI management while ensuring reference consistency.

### Definitions
- **DOI (Digital Object Identifier)**: a unique and permanent identifier for a digital document (article, report, etc.) to facilitate location and citation.  
- **API (Application Programming Interface)**: a software interface that enables communication between programs to automate data exchange.
