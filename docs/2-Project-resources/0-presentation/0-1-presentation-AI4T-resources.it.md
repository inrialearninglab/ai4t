# Presentation of the AI4T resources
You will find here the documents, resources and tools that contributed to the project, from its conception to its implementation in the context of the AI4T experimentation.

**Most of those resources are in English**. They are organised in three sections:

- Section 1 - AI (Educational) tools used during the experimentation phase in the 5 countries  
- Section 2 - List of Moocs and online resources related to AI or AI & Education  
- Section 3 - Reports and Guidelines related to AI and Education
