### How and Why use Chatbots in the Classroom? by Laetitia ALLEGRINI
Laetitia is a specialised school teacher, option F, and a member of the AI working group at the DRANE of the Académie d'Aix-Marseille.
Today, in the age of artificial intelligence (AI), teachers have new tools at their disposal. The use and creation of conversational agents or "chatbots" can, among other things, assist the teacher, support and accompany the student in his or her learning... These aids could become powerful and innovative teaching tools. During this presentation, we will answer the question: "How and why should chatbots be integrated into the classroom? For each of the three categories of conversational units, you will discover concrete examples from the classroom. We'll be highlighting the key role of the teacher in implementing chatbots within a teaching scenario, in order to avoid certain biases. In your view, could the integration of chatbots in education symbolise a future in which Artificial Intelligence becomes an inclusive educational tool, helping to promote learning?
