Curiosity plays a key role in children's learning, both in and out of school. It is one of the driving forces that can lead them to flourish by taking pleasure in learning, and stimulating their perseverance and creativity. Drawing on its fundamental work in cognitive science and AI to model curiosity in children, the Flowers team at Inria has been working for several years on their application in the field of education. Pierre-Yves Oudeyer will present two projects carried out in collaboration between the Flowers team and edTech company evidenceB. One uses personalized learning methods to stimulate curiosity in the learning of maths, now widely disseminated in the Adaptiv'Maths software supported by the French Ministry of Education and accessible in all schools in France (68,000 classes). The other, where we are experimenting with the highly promising capabilities of language models to set up conversational agents that train children to ask inquisitive questions. He will also discuss the challenges of AI literacy in middle and high schools, and several pedagogical tools designed to contribute to it.
