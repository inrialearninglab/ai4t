Behind ChatGPT and the many debates that have accompanied it, there is the fundamental question of what is at stake in generative AI. Particularly in view of their many implications for education.

## 1 - Understanding ChatGPT

To give you a better idea of what these language models are, the AI4T pedagogical team has put together a series of videos by Alexandre Torres-Leguet, Clément Romac, Thomas Carta and Pierre-Yves Oudeyer, members of Inria's Flowers team. It is distributed under Creative Commons CC-BY license.

### Episode#1: How do language models work?

**« How does ChatGPT work? An overview in less than 5 minutes»** (in French)

### Episode#2: How to get a language model to perform a task?

**« Prompting, or the art of making yourself understood by ChatGPT: Explained in 5 minutes.»** (in French)
Synopsis: This video introduces the notion of prompting, which makes a language model (including ChatGPT) perform a certain task by explaining it to it using natural language sentences. Examples are shown of two prompting methods (explaining the task in natural language, and giving examples of how to perform the task).

### Episode#4: The strengths of language models

**« The strengths of language models »** (in French)
Synopsis: This video presents the main strengths of language models such as ChatGPT or Bard. Despite certain weaknesses, they also possess a large number of strengths, such as :
- their ability to analyze a given context to provide an appropriate response to a task
- their use of external tools (e.g. Wikipedia)
- the wide range of data on which they have been trained
- their ability to produce basic reasoning
- their "common sense" in certain contexts
- their ability to help us come up with creative ideas

## 2 - Possible uses in education
Two French publications from the French Ministry of Education and the Pôle d'Expertise de la Régulation Numérique complement each other and take us a step further in discovering the possible uses in education of language models (1) and the AI technologies (2) that underpin them.
