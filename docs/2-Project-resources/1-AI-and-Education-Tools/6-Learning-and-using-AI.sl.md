# Learning and Using AI

This chapter present some of the more advanced tools used by the AI4T partners during the experimentation phase.

## Scratch

- What: *Platform for learning to code, with a simple visual interface that lets young people create digital stories, games and animations. Possibility of creating AI simulation programs with Scratch.*
- By: Scratch Foundation
- Access to the resource: [https://scratch.mit.edu/search/projects?q=IA](https://scratch.mit.edu/search/projects?q=IA){:target="_blank"}
- Language: EN

## Machine Learning For kids

- What: *"A simple tool for training a variety of types of machine learning model, and an environment for creating games and other interactive projects that use them. This is done by extending Scratch: a visual programming environment created to teach coding to kids, that is widely used in schools. It gives students a blank canvas without prescribing what they make. They're free to use their imagination and creativity to find fun uses for the machine learning models that they train"*.
