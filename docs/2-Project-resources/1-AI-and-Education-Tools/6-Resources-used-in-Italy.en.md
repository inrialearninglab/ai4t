# Presentation of resources used for Pilot Phase by Italy

## Tools used during webinars

### Teachable Machine[^1]:

- What: "*Teachable Machine is a web-based tool available to anyone, which allows you to create machine learning models quickly and easily.* "

- By: Google Creative lab

### QuickDraw[^2]

- What: "*This game is based on machine learning. You draw, and a neural network tries to guess what your drawing represents. Of course, it doesn't always succeed, but the more you play, the better the network gets. So far we have taught it a few hundred concepts, and we hope to add more over time. This game shows that machine learning can be fun*".

### Sketch_RNN[^3]

- What: "*An interactive web experiment that lets you draw together with a recurrent neural network model called [sketch-rnn](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03477). We taught this neural net to draw by training it on millions of doodles collected from the [Quick, Draw!](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data/) game. Once you start drawing an object, sketch-rnn will come up with many possible ways to continue drawing this object based on where you left off. Try the [first demo](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/assets/sketch_rnn_demo/index.html).*"

### This person does not exist[^4]

- What: "*Random Face Generator , Generate random human face in 1 click and download it! AI generated fake person photos: man, woman or child"."The AI face generator is powered by StyleGAN, a neural network from Nvidia developed in 2018*."

### Let's play paper, scissors, stone[^5]

- What: "*Play Paper; scissor and stone against your computer*". "*The demo is built on (a)GPU-accelerated [TensorFire](https://tenso.rs/) library for fully in-browser deep learning. It's fast enough to perform real-time client-side classification of live webcam video, and we're showing it off here with a cute little game.*"

- By: Tensor Fire - "*a group of recent MIT graduates who all think this whole "deep learning" thing is pretty neat*".
