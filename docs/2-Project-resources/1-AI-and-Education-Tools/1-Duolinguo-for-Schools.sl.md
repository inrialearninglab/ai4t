title: Duolinguo for Schools
description: Tool used during the experimentation (France)
---

The AI4T consortium has identified ["Duolingo for Schools"](https://schools.duolingo.com/){:target="_blank"} as a relevant AI tool to be experimented by teachers during the project.

It's a learning language App, for sure. And, as an AI Educational Resource, it raises questions that are relevant across disciplines.

There are two particularities of Duolingo for Schools that makes it's a good case study:

    - Duolingo shares a lot of info about how it works,
    - Used by many learners, it has been the focus of many questions from outsiders concerned about privacy, for example. It is therefore easier to have insights about some issues that are generally not that easy to have about AIERs, like data protection.

Duolingo for Schools is presented in the French Mooc (M4. AI at our service as teachers?) as a case study to experiment the "Template for AI characterisation" designed by Loria laboratory during the AI4T project.
