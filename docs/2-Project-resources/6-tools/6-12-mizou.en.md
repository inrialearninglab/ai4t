## Description [^1]

Mizou is a platform for designing customised chatbots for learning and learning monitoring.

## Main features

- Grammar correction assistance: Mizou automatically detects and corrects grammatical errors in texts written by students.
- Personalised explanations: When an error is detected, Mizou provides detailed explanations of the grammatical rule, allowing the student to better understand their mistake.
- Progress tracking: Mizou offers personalised tracking of each student's progress, allowing weak areas to be identified and the study programme to be adapted accordingly.

## Example of classroom use [^2]

A French teacher uses Mizou as a grammar assistant for their students. Each week, students must write an essay at home. Once they have written their text, they submit it to Mizou for correction. The tool provides explanations of grammatical errors, allowing students to understand why a certain structure is incorrect and receive suggestions on how to correct it.

## Practical tips

✅ Use for homework: Ask students to submit their homework to Mizou before handing it in class. This will allow them to self-correct and improve their understanding of grammar rules.

✅ Integrate the results into class: Use the frequent errors identified by Mizou to guide revision in class, addressing common difficulties among pupils.
