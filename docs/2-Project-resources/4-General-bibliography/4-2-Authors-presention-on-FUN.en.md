# Who Contributed to this Course?
As shown in the list of contributors below, this Mooc is a collective work! It is the result of the work carried out within the European project AI4T and also includes resources from the Mooc "Artificial Intelligence ... with Intelligence!". It has also benefited from the contributions and expertise of partners involved in the project. Finally, we would like to emphasize the support and guidance of the Direction du Numérique pour l'éducation (MENJ / [DNE-TN2](https://edunumrech.hypotheses.org/author/dnetn2)) in the production of this course.
