## Description[^1]

Teachable Machine is a web-based tool that allows you to train artificial intelligence (AI) models without the need for coding or creating an account. It uses machine learning to recognise images, sounds, or body poses.

## Features

- Image recognition: Identifies objects, facial expressions, or drawings.

- Sound recognition: Differentiates specific sounds or voice commands.

- Pose recognition: Analyses body movements to detect different postures or gestures.

## Example of educational use[^2]

A science teacher asks students to train a model to recognise different plant species from photos taken on a school trip. The AI learns to differentiate between leaves, and students discover how automatic classification works.

## Practical tips

- Use a variety of examples to avoid bias in the AI.

- Check the accuracy of the model and adjust the training data if necessary.
