# Presentation of resources used for Pilot Phase by Luxembourg

Tools or websites that aim at learning and/or using AI are listed here.

At the end of the page, "*Our Algorithms*" is more dedicated to raising awareness and questioning "*the ethics and opportunities of public algorithms in order to guarantee their mission of general interest, today and tomorrow*".

## Learning about AI / Using AI

### MIT Media Lab[^1]

- What: "*The MIT Media Lab is a research laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.. Its research does not restrict to fixed academic disciplines, but draws from technology, media, science, art, and design*". It lead, among other things, several innovative programme about Kids and computing, the most famous being Scratch.

- Language: EN

###  Cognimates[^2]

- What: An AI education platform for building games, programming robots & training AI models

- Language: EN

###  Experiment with Google[^3]

- What: AI Experiments is a showcase for simple experiments that make it easier for anyone to start exploring machine learning, through pictures, drawings, language, music, and more

- Language: EN

- By: AI Experiments host many AI related activities, some well known as the following ones.

####   Teachable Machine[^4]

- What: "*Teachable Machine is a web-based tool available to anyone, which allows you to create machine learning models quickly and easily*."

- By: Google Creative lab

####    QuickDraw[^5]

- What: "*A game where a neural net tries to guess what you're drawing*."

- By: Google Creative lab

####   AutoDraw[^6]

- What: "*Fast drawing for everyone*."

- By: Google Creative lab

###   Tensorflow[^7]

- What: "*TensorFlow provides tutorials,example, and other resources to passed up model building and create scalable ML Solutions*."

- Language: EN, FR, IT

###   Machine Learning For kids[^8]

- What: "*A simple tool for training a variety of types of machine learning model, and an environment for creating games and other interactive projects that use them.This is done by extending Scratch*[^9]*: a visual programming environment created to teach coding to kids, that is widely used in schools. It gives students a blank canvas without prescribing what they make. They're free to use their imagination and creativity to find fun uses for the machine learning models that they train*".

- Language: EN, FR, IT,

###   Try AI[^10]

- What: Machine Learning for High School Students

- Language: EN

###   Beat the Crocodile[^11]

- What: "*reinforcement learning*". You are playing the monkeys. Each piece moves like a pawn, i.e. it can move forward and capture diagonally. You win, if

1.  One of your pieces reaches the opposite end of the board.

2.  You opponent can not move

3.  Or you capture all your opponent pieces

## Raising awareness

### Our Algorithms[^12] (Nos algorithmes)

- What: "*Our Algorithms is a collaborative project exploring the questions of ethics and opportunities for public algorithms, in the light of the present and futures.*""
