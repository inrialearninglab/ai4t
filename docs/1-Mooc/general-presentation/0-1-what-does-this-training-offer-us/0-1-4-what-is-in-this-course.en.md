# What is in this Course?

## Course objective
The main objective of this course is to give teachers and the entire educational community a basic to solid culture about AI: understanding AI, how it works, its challenges and consequences.

In a more concrete way, this course has been designed to help teachers make up their own minds on the following questions:

- What is AI for in the context of Education?
- What kind of AI for what purpose?
- What are the benefits and challenges?
- How to use AI-based resources?
- What impacts can be anticipated in teaching and learning practices?

## Course organisation

The course is organised in 4 modules:

- M1. Using AI in education
- M2. What is meant by AI?
- M3. How does AI work?
- M4. AI at our service as teachers?

The total duration of the course is estimated between 2 to 3 hours, depending on how much time you want to spend doing the activities and consulting the supporting documents.

## Content types

There are 5 types of contents in this course:

- Text: to discover short synthesis based on scientific literature and expert reports.
- Quiz: to take short actions (quizzes, drag-the-word) at the end of texts to help anchor the concepts presented.
- Video: to give the floor to a project promoter or to discover the challenges of AI to accompany students. Some videos come from the French Mooc "Intelligence artificielle avec Intelligence" and can be used in classroom.
- Activity: to promote self-questioning, to strengthen the knowledge of the milestones of AI or transfer what has been read or discovered previously to specific situations.
- Tutorial: to experiment how a program "learns" and the role of data in machine learning.

Now, let's get started and dive into the heart of the Mooc!
