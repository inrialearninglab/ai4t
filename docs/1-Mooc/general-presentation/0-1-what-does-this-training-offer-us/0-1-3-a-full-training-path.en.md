-   the present online training course, designed as a Mooc, and consisting of 4 modules with a total duration from 2 to 3 hours,

-   online training resources to go further on AI and Education,

-   an online textbook,

-   webinars to share practices and opinions,

-   and guided trainings, in-person and online, for participants interactions with AI and Education experts.

The total duration of the training is planned for 3 months over a period from November 2022 to March 2023 depending on the countries involved in the experiment.
