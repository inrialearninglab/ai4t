# Context of the experimentation
On the different learning platforms (LMS or CMS) used by the 5 countries participating in this AI Training for teachers and school leaders, it is possible to follow the learning path of the participants. This is achieved using “learning traces” that reflect the learner's action when browsing the content of the course, watching a video, or doing an online activity.

All collected traces related to the learning paths are pseudo-anonymized in order to prevent the identification of learners in compliance with the RGPD principles.

In addition, this follow-up is never carried out in order to evaluate participants but is used for the experimentation and research purposes of this current experimentation only.

This experimentation is conducted during the large-scale experimentation phase of the AI4T project from November 2022 to March 2023.
