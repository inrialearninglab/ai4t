# Activity: Tutorial Let's test our first program

Image recognition is an area of AI that has seen considerable growth. This tutorial proposes to test image recognition and to train a program to recognize cats and docs. Then it reminds us that this program can only do what it has been trained to do, and that it can be fooled!

Including 7 very short pedagogical videos, the tutorial can be used with an audience of high school or secondary school students.
