# What types of AI applications in Education

Among the possible classifications of AI scientific domains, the following table presents an AI taxonomy[^1] according to the family functions possibly performed by AI.

Let's see which AI techniques are used in the AI-based education-oriented applications proposed by Holmes & al. in 2019[^2].

Each AI-based educational tool or resource has its own specific techniques. However, it is sometimes possible to guess which ones are likely to be used for a given resource.

Let's take some examples:

- **Dialogue-based tutoring system**, as a student teaching service
Such systems are likely to use: **communication** techniques such as natural language processing for speech and language understanding and generation and **reasoning** techniques for tutoring purposes

- **Course recommendation**, as a student supporting service
As for personalised marketing offers and recommendations functions that can be found on the Internet, course recommendation systems are probably based on **machine learning** techniques by analysing relevant current data related to the student learning path and identifying similarities to previous generalised student learning paths.

- **Student attention and emotion detection**, as a teacher supporting service
Such a system is likely to use **perception** techniques (computer vision for facial recognition for example) and **machine learning** techniques to analyse the student's facial expressions or behaviour if such information are collected and analysed.
