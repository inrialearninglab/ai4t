#### Synopsis
The main character _Guillaume_ lists the many applications or tools that use algorithms and highlights their place in our daily lives. He starts by questioning computers and computer science which leads him to ask the question: "*Have our computers become intelligent or not?*".
_Guillaume_ then turns his interest to biological intelligence, whose functioning allows him to ask questions about the "real intelligence" of AI and its different approaches: symbolic, digital... The conclusion of the video is that all the artificial intelligences we encounter in everyday life are restricted to specific tasks, far from the representations we can have in movies or in fiction!
