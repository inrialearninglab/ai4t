# Activity: Boosted with AI?
There is no better way to understand how machine learning and program training works than to understand how to properly prepare your dataset.

In this tutorial are inserted 7 very short pedagogical videos which make the tutorials usable with an audience of high school (or secondary school) students if desired.

**_Note1_**: This tutorial does not store any personal data. The images are processed locally on the user's machine. It can be used with the following browsers: Edge, Chrome, Mozilla, Safari, Opera.

**_Note2_**: This tutorial proposes to upload your own images to experiment machine learning and the importance of datasets to train the algorithm. It's also possible to download already prepared 2 data sets:  
- Download the [image set of Charles Dickens](Images/Images-set-of-Charles-Dickens.zip)  
- Download the [image set for William Shakespear](Images/Images-set-of-William-Shakespear.zip).
