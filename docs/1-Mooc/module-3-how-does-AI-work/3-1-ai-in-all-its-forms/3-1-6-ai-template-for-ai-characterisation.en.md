# A Template for AI characterisation

Although Artificial Intelligence Educational Resources -AIERs- are becoming increasingly common, there is currently no tool to comprehensively map the characteristics of AIERs and help users make informed use of these resources.

The LORIA[^1] Research Laboratory specifically designed a template for AI characterisation[^2] at the scientific, technical, regulatory, and ethical levels to help teachers to better understand the resources they or their students use.

It is organised in different layers that cover all the features of the AIER, from usage scenarios to the transparency mechanism to explain the decision proposed by the AI.

The Template in a ready-to-use format[^3] can also be uploaded and filled in for your own AI Educational tools and resources.
