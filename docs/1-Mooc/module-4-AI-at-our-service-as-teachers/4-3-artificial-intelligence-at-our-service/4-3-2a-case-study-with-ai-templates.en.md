# Activity: Case study with AI template to analyse Duolingo for school

The AI4T consortium has identified "*Duolingo for Schools*" as a relevant AI tool to be experimented by teachers during the project.

It's a learning language App, for sure, but the question it raises as an AIERs are relevant across disciplines.

During this activity, Duolingo for Schools is proposed as a case study to experiment the Template for AI characterisation. There are two particularities of Duolingo for Schools that makes it's a good case study:

1. Duolingo shares a lot of info about how it works,
2. Used by many learners, it has been the focus of many questions from outsiders concerned about privacy, for example. It is therefore easier to have insights about some issues that are generally not that easy to have about AIERs, like data protection.

## Duolingo for Schools in its own words

Here is the official presentation of Duolingo for Schools on its blog[^1]: "*Duolingo for Schools is a dashboard right inside of a teacher's Duolingo account that allows them to create classrooms and assignments, and to follow students' activity. We're excited to work with educators to bring the world's number one language learning app into classrooms, with features designed to maximize teacher effectiveness and student learning*".
