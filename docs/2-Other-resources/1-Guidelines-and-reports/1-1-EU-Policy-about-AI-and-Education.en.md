**In progress**: Regulatory Framework Proposal on Artificial Intelligence[^XXX]
*"The Commission is proposing the first-ever legal framework on AI, which addresses the risks of AI and positions Europe to play a leading role globally"*

!!! Note "Extract"
      *The proposed AI regulation ensures that Europeans can trust what AI has to offer. While most AI systems pose limited to no risk and can contribute to solving many societal challenges, certain AI systems create risks that we must address to avoid undesirable outcomes.*

!!! Example "Notable content "
    - This Regulatory Framework defines 4 levels of risk in AI:

        1 - Unacceptable risk  
        2 - High risk  
        3 - Limited risk  
        4 - Minimal or no risk
    -  **Educational or vocational training** are assessed as **2 - High risk** "*as that may determine the access to education and professional course of someone's life (e.g. scoring of exams).*"


## European Union policy : The Digital Education Action Plan

!!! Note
    *A policy initiative that sets out a common vision of high-quality, inclusive and accessible digital education in Europe, and aims to support the adaptation of the education and training systems of Member States to the digital age.*
