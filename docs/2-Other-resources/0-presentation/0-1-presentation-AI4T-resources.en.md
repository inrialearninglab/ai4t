# Presentation of the AI4T resources
In addition to the Mooc itself and the training resources offered to
deepen certain topics, you will find here the documents, resources and
tools that contributed to the project, from its conception (drafting of
the application form) to its first implementation (pilot phase).

**All those elements are in English** - Some very interesting references
could have been dropped if they were not available in an English
version.

At the end of the Large Scale Experimentation Phase, a collection of all
resources per language can be organised in collaboration with partners
if the need arises

Those elements are organised in three sections:

#### Section 1 - Reports and Guidelines that were at the beginning of the project

In defining the objectives of the AI4T project, the project promoters
drew on a range of reports and contributions from different
institutions.

The publications are accessible in the section, organised by issuing
institutions.

Note: If there have been any updates or new developments since the 2020
project was written, these have also been listed.

#### Section 2 - List of Moocs and on-lin resources related to AI or AI & Education

The subject of artificial intelligence is so fascinating that many
Massive Open Online Courses are dedicated to it.

In this section, a selection of Moocs is presented and organised as
follows

1. AI in general

2. and AI in education


#### Section 3 - Resources used during the first phase of thee project organised by country

During the first phase of the AI4T project, a range of resources were
used/shared by the partners. They are gathered here in line with their
relevance for the next phases of the project.
