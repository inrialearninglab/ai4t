# Presentation of resources used for Pilot Phase

During the first phase of the AI4T project, the pilot phase, a range of resources were used/shared by the partners.

Some of these are brought together in this section in the following
organisation

-   All On-line resources and Moocs are gathered in another place: Other resources / 2-1 Moocs and on-line resources[^1]

-   Resources mentioned are all in English

-   The resources should be relevant to the next phases of the project (the Large-Scale Experimentation Phase and then the Dissemination Phase) - some very interesting items have been left out of this section, e.g. they are only available in a language other than English.
