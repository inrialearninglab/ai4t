##  Step 1: Forking the AI4T GitHub repository of the Mooc.

### **Step 1.0** - Create an account on GitHub - it's free

The preliminary step is to create an account on GitHub if you do not already have one.

[Access to the sign up page on GitHub](https://GitHub.com/signup?return_to=https%3A%2F%2FGitHub.com%2Finrialearninglab%2Fai4t&source=login)

### **Step 1.1** - Access the GitHub repository of the project AI4T

Adress of the GitHub repository of the AI4T project : [https://GitHub.com/inrialearninglab/ai4t](https://GitHub.com/inrialearninglab/ai4t)

### **Step 1.2** - Create a **fork** of the repository

A fork is an extensive copy of elements (from contents to commands) of
the GitHub repository but it is detached from the **main**.

Therefore you can do whatever you want in it without impacting the AI4T Mooc.
However if you want to keep up with evolution in the **main**, you can **synchronise** your fork whenever you want

Once created, the fork has to be named.

#### We encourage you to :

1 : Choose the right name for your account

2 : Keep **AI4T** in the repository name

3 : And to add as **description** the new target language you are
developing

**Remember** : It's always possible to keep up with the evolution of the initial GitHub repository by "sychronising" you own repository with the AI4T one.

### **Step 1.3** - Your fork is now ready at your personalised URL address :

Example of personalised URL : https://GitHub.com/ **YOURNAME** /ai4t
