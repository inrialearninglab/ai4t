## Build Your Own Training: why this section & how to navigate its content

### Using GitHub in an educational project : why?

To create and host the AI4T Mooc and complementary training resources,
we, at the Inria Learning Lab, choose to use a tool normally used by
developers, i.e. a **forge**.

This solution enabled us to co-construct, organise, maintain, translate
and share the educational resources designed for AI4T. It's also Open
Source and free of charge.

### How to use Github to build your own AI4T training

This **Build your own training** part is a step by step methodology to support those who wish to use the AI4T Mooc resources, translate them and organise them to build their own AI for and through teacher training.

Here is a graphic presentation of the contents of Build your own training.
