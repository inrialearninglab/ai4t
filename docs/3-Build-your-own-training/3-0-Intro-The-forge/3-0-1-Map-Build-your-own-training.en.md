## Build Your Own Training Using GitHub

To create and host the AI4T Mooc and complementary training resources, we, at the Inria Learning Lab, choose to use GitHub, a tool normally used by developers, i.e. a **forge**.

This solution enabled us to co-construct, organise, maintain, translate and share the educational resources designed for AI4T. It's also Open Source and free of charge.

## How to use Github to build your own AI training

This **Build your own training** part is a step by step methodology to support those who wish to use the AI4T Mooc resources, translate them and organise them to build their own "AI for teacher training".

Here is a graphic representation of the "Build Your own Training" 3-Step Process.
