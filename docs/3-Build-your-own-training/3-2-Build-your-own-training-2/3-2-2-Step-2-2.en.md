# Presentation
## Where to find the texts of the Mooc to proofread and correct

All texts, images and activities of the 4 Modules + Presentation
Module + Conclusion Module will be available in a Github repository you
have created (**[Creating and translating files in another language Septembre 2023)](./3-2-1-Step-2-1.en.md)**

And they will be accessible at :
https://github.com/[YOURNAME]/ai4t/tree/main/docs/1-Mooc

Clicking on the text \"module-1-using-AI-and-Education\" will leads to
the contents of the module, organised in chapters:

    <figcaption>Visual 1 - contents of folder 1-Mooc as layed out on GitHub - screencaption of github.</figcaption>
</figure>


Clicking on a chapter leads to the chapter pages in all 5 languages:
<figure>
    <img src="Images/3.2-contents of folder-1-2-screen-caption-github.png" alt="visual 2 - contents of folder 1-2 of the Mooc as layed out on GitHub - screen caption ">
    <figcaption>Visual 2 - contents of folder 1-2 of the Mooc as layed out on GitHub - screen caption of Github.</figcaption>
</figure>


> **Nomenclature of file names for chapter pages**
>
> **Example for the page: 1-2-1a-lets-focus-on-your-own-AI-tools.en.md**

-   **1** module 1

-   x-2 chapter 2

-   x-x-1 page 1

-   x-x-xa = page that contains an activity

-   x-x-xv = page that contains a video

-   **lets-focus-on-your-own-AI-tools**: title of the reference file

-   **.fr** language

-   **.md** text in markdown format (lightweight markup language)

In the example mentioned (1-2-1a-lets-focus-on-your-own-AI-tools.en.md),
this is the first page of chapter 2 of module 1; it contains an
activity.

-   **.xml** metadata associated with the page of the same name

### The texts

Each chapter (e.g. chapter
\"1-1-are-teachers-really-concerned-by-Artificial-Intelligence\")
contains:

-   the texts of all pages of this chapter in all languages (.md files
in markdown format). [Only the texts in your language]{.underline}
need to be [proofread and corrected]{.underline}.

-   the metadata for each page in this chapter in all languages (.xml
files). There is no need to proofread and correct the metadata
files.

### The images

They are grouped together for each chapter of the Mooc in an
\"**Images**\" folder. It is important not to [remove the content of the
\"Images\" folders]{.underline}. If you wish to add or modify images, be
careful of using the same naming procedure as used in the folder.

    <figcaption>Visual 3 : identification of an image folder - screen caption of Github.</figcaption>
</figure>


### ðŸ”ŽResearch function

A **search function** in Github can help you find the file you want to
modify. It is located at the top left of the interface as shown below:

## How to proofread and correct translated texts

> To allow contributors / reviewer to modify the texts of the Github
> repository :

1.  Create a Github account:
https:[[//github.com/join]{.underline}](https://github.com/join) and
specify :

a.  their \"Username\".

b.  their email address

2.  Send those infos to the administrator of your repository for
updating the list of Github accounts that should have the rights of
contributors to correct the texts, specifying the \"Username\"
and/or email address used to create the accounts.

> Then, you have to connect to your Github account

> **ATTENTION:**

-   There is no automatic saving of changes: we therefore recommend that
you publish your changes (i.e. after clicking on \"Commit changes\")
by correction step (e.g. adding references, correcting the
translation, adding a paragraph, etc.) for each page.

-   Changes are only visible to other contributors once published.

-   Do **not change** the title of the page (i.e. the name of the file)

> below: 1-2-1a-lets-focus-on-your-own-AI-tools.en.md
>
> ![](media/image3.png){width="6.267716535433071in"
> height="0.2638888888888889in"}

-   Do **not change the** page **header** at the top of each page, which
is delimited by 2 lines of 3 dashes (\-\--).

> \-\--

## What to check

-   **Graphics and images**\
Images and graphics with English text can be translated:

-   If they are not understandable in English

-   If you find an alternative to replace the image in your
language.

-   **Sources and bibliographical references**

> An important work is to be done in order to complement or replace
> ressources in English mentioned in the Mooc. Here are two solutions we
> adopted within the project.

-   Where no substitution is possible: maintenance of the EN resource
(see AI watch, JRC publications, etc.)

-   Where an alternative resource exists, it can be listed alongside the
original resource.

During the dissemination phase and in order to be as close as possible
to the local context, the addition of references in the target languages
is recommended.

-   **Reminder about translation quality /accuracy**

> The translated text are generated by DeepL from the reference EN
> version of the Mooc. Adjustments to improve the quality of the
> translation may be required **and** first proofreading must be carried
> out; sometimes DeepL interprets signs (such as \*) incorrectly and
> there may be discrepancies in the translation (one or more elements of
> the text have remained in the source language). A first \"formal
> clean-up\" of the translation is therefore useful before moving on to
> the substantive proofreading.
