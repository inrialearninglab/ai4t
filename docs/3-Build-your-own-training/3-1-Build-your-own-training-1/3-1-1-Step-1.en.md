# Forking the AI4T github repository

### **Step 0** - Create an account on github - it's free

The preliminary step is to create an account on github if you do not already have one.

[Access to the sign up page on Github](https://github.com/signup?return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Finrialearninglab%2Fai4t&source=login)

### **Step 1** - Access the github repository of the project AI4T

Adress of the github repository of the AI4T project : [https://github.com/inrialearninglab/ai4t](https://github.com/inrialearninglab/ai4t)

### **Step 2** - Create a **fork** of the repository

A fork is an extensive copy of elements (from contents to commands) of
the github repository but it is detached from the **main**.

Therefore you can do whatever you want in it without impacting the AI4T Mooc.
However if you want to keep up with evolution in the **main**, you can **synchronise** your fork whenever you want

Once created, the fork has to be named.

#### We encourage you to :

1 : Choose the right name for your account

2 : Keep AI4T in the repository name

3 : And to add as **description** the new target language you are
developing

**Remember** : It's alaways possible to keep up with the evolution of the initial github repository by "sychronizing" you own repository with the AI4T one.

### **Step 3** - Your fork is now ready at your personalised URL address :

Example of personalised URL : https://github.com/YOURNAME/ai4t
