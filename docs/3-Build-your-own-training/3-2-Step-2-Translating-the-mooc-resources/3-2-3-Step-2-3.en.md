## Step 2 - part 3: Where to find the videos of the Mooc

## Videos are available in different languages

Within the AI4T project spam life, most of the Mooc's videos have been produced in the 5 languages of the partnership (ie : English, German,
French, Italian & Slovenian) with different solutions depending on the nature / origin of the video.

#### The 6 videos from the Mooc "[Artificial intelligence with intelligence](https://inrialearninglab.GitHub.io/ai4t//1-Mooc/module-2-what-is-meant-by-ai/2-1-how-to-define-ai/2-1-1v-who-is-afraid-of-ai.html)"
