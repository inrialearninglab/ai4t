All videos of the Mooc are hosted on the YouTube channel of the project [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBd_PgP_BdhmgdSzz5d83vQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBd_PgP_BdhmgdSzz5d83vQ)

## Videos are available in different languages

Within the AI4T project lifespan, most of the Mooc's videos have been produced in the 5 languages of the partnership (ie : English, German, French, Italian & Slovenian) with different solutions depending on the nature / origin of the video.

*The 6 "humorous" IAI videos are:*

-   ðŸ”ˆ originally in French

-   ðŸŽ§ with **voice-over** in English, Italian and Slovenia

-   ðŸŽ¬ with **subtitles** in French, English, Italian and Slovenian

*The [introductory](https://inrialearninglab.GitHub.io/ai4t//1-Mooc/general-presentation/0-1-what-does-this-training-offer-us/0-1-1v-why-this-training.html) & [conclusion](https://inrialearninglab.GitHub.io/ai4t//1-Mooc/to-conclude/7-0-1v-ethical-use-of-artificial-intelligence-in-education.html) videos* by Alain Thillay, one of the project initiator are:

  -   ðŸ”ˆ originally in French

  -   ðŸŽ§ with **voice-over** in English, German, Italian and Slovenia

  -   ðŸŽ¬ with **subtitles** available in English, French, German, Italian and Slovenian

*The 3 videos of [A Walk through AI](https://inrialearninglab.GitHub.io/ai4t//1-Mooc/module-1-using-AI-and-Education/1-1-are-teachers-really-concerned-by-Artificial-Intelligence/1-1-1-the-learning-process-in-education.html)* have been designed while taking into account multilingualism (absence of textual contents in the videos to facilitate their adaptation to any language).

They are :

  -   ðŸ”ˆ originally in English

  -   ðŸŽ§ with **dubbing** in French, German, Italian and Slovenia

  -   ðŸŽ¬ with **subtitles** available in English, French, German, Italian and Slovenian

Note: all voice-overs and dubbing were made by native speakers.

## Where to find the subtitles of the Mooc's videos

All subtitles (in .srt format) are gathered in one folder on the GitHub repository. They can be downloaded from the folder [**Subtitles/SRT-videos-AI4T-dissemination**](https://GitHub.com/inrialearninglab/ai4t/tree/mooc-v3/sources-to-download/Subtitles/SRT-videos-AI4T-dissemination)

    <p>For each resource, the files are organised by language. Note: as shown above, most of the Mooc resources are available in 5 languages, but some are available in 3 or 4 languages, due to the different needs of the partners during the project's experimental phase).</p>
