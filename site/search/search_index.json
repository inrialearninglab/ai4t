Type: text Description: Locate the training in the European framework Subject: Artificial Intelligence for and by Teachers Authors: AI4T Licence: CC BY 4.0 Date: 2022-11-15 What is the Objective of this Training? \u00b6 Artificial Intelligence in Education \u00b6 This training on Artificial Intelligence for teachers and the entire educational community was developed and experimented at the European level in 5 countries: France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, and Slovenia. The objective of this training has several layers: To demystify and understand AI ; To experiment and make good use of educational digital resources with AI services; To contribute to the development of digital skills in all educators and students that include an ethical dimension beyond the technical or regulatory aspects of AI. The first level \" demystify and understand \" AI in the dedicated field of education aims at overcoming enthusiastic or fearful discourses on AI, not to say only the potential or to give up using it even before having experienced it and the feedback. It leads to the identification of types of AI and examples of AI algorithms in order to explain the general principles and to give an understanding of the intended effects, possible biases, benefits gained or unacceptable situations. The project aims to answer some direct questions such as: Which AI techniques are available and useful for the stated purposes? Which developments are needed for my teaching context? What assistance can it give me? What questions do I need to ask myself to get started in a reasoned way? The second level, \" experiment and use wisely AI \", aims to describe one's objectives (or needs) and to test resources dedicated to learning, whether or not they are adapted to the school context, as long as they respect the regulations on personal data in particular. The idea is to offer teachers the possibility to identify, test and assess the benefit of the resource used, and even the contexts and cases where it is relevant and those where it is not. It is also to appreciate the integration of the AI tools into the wider and more complex framework of the student's learning journey. As we all know, the addition of micro-learning is not automatic. The use of AI for specific learning is useful. It allows the analysis of learning traces on fairly simple objects, or to work overtime on forgetting curves for example, but it does not replace the contact and appreciation of the teacher in his daily relationship with the pupils, which also plays a role in learning over time. The third level invites participants not to remain focused solely on technical issues or subject learning but also to exchange within his or her school with colleagues and the school management , and to share in the school's missions, the first of which is living together, equity and respect for human rights. As in all educational activities, the ethical dimension is a transversal component. AI highlights it even more because its fields of application - in particular in education - are still to be defined and its effects studied.","title":"0.1.2 What is the Objective of this Training?"},{"location":"1-Mooc/general-presentation/0-1-what-does-this-training-offer-us/0-1-2-training-objectives.html#what-is-the-objective-of-this-training","text":"","title":"What is the Objective of this Training?"},{"location":"1-Mooc/general-presentation/0-1-what-does-this-training-offer-us/0-1-2-training-objectives.html#artificial-intelligence-in-education","text":"This training on Artificial Intelligence for teachers and the entire educational community was developed and experimented at the European level in 5 countries: France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, and Slovenia.

Some of these websites are also able to tell which films we can go and see with our family, and which ones with a group of friends. The question we ask ourselves is: Why not use the same strategies to personalise learning paths by providing the teacher with appropriate learning resources for a student or group of students? If we take another example, based on the captors present on our smartphones. Some applications allow us to record our movements, measure the number of steps we take every day, visualise and analyse the calories we have burned, the performance we have achieved during the last run, or the diet we should follow to reach our weight goals. Another question we can ask is: Wouldn't activity tracking also be useful in teaching, to better identify, understand and support the learner? Since such many captors and software tools can provide feedback, synthesis, predictions, recommendations, and visualisations of all the analyses carried out, to optimise activities in diverse fields. Why not take advantage of these technological frameworks of artificial intelligence to optimise the field of education? In this context, we propose \"A walk through Artificial Intelligence\", a series of 3 introductory videos to dig deeper through these questions and explore the role of Artificial Intelligence, more specifically learning analytics, can play in education. Learning Analytics is commonly defined as the observation, analysis and visualisation of the learner's digital behaviours in their online learning activity.

Since such many captors and software tools can provide feedback, synthesis, predictions, recommendations, and visualisations of all the analyses carried out, to optimise activities in diverse fields. Why not take advantage of these technological frameworks of artificial intelligence to optimise the field of education? In this context, we propose \"A walk through Artificial Intelligence\", a series of 3 introductory videos to dig deeper through these questions and explore the role of Artificial Intelligence, more specifically learning analytics, can play in education. Learning Analytics is commonly defined as the observation, analysis and visualisation of the learner's digital behaviours in their online learning activity.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"1-Mooc/module-1-using-AI-and-Education/1-1-are-teachers-really-concerned-by-Artificial-Intelligence/1-1-1-the-learning-process-in-education.html#video-n1-a-walk-through-artificial-intelligence-the-learning-process-in-education","text":"Watch the video below (2'50\")","title":"Video n\u00b01: A walk through Artificial Intelligence: The Learning Process in Education"},{"location":"1-Mooc/module-1-using-AI-and-Education/1-1-are-teachers-really-concerned-by-Artificial-Intelligence/1-1-2-guiding-pupils.html","text":"Metadata Id: EU.AI4T.O1.M1.1.2v Title: 1.1.2 Video: A Walk through AI - Guiding pupils to success Type: video Description: Video 2 A Walk through AI - Guiding pupils to success through observation of learning processes Subject: Artificial Intelligence for and by Teachers Authors: AI4T Anne, Boyer - Loria Armelle, Brun - Loria Azim, Roussanaly - Loria Guilherme, Medeiros-Machado - Loria Licence: CC BY 4.0 Date: 2022-11-15 A Walk through AI - Guiding pupils to success through observation of learning processes \u00b6 Video n\u00b02: A Walk through AI - Guiding pupils to success through observation of learning processes \u00b6 Watch the video below (3'10\")","title":"1.1.2 Video: A Walk through AI - Guiding pupils to success"},{"location":"1-Mooc/module-1-using-AI-and-Education/1-1-are-teachers-really-concerned-by-Artificial-Intelligence/1-1-2-guiding-pupils.html#a-walk-through-ai-guiding-pupils-to-success-through-observation-of-learning-processes","text":"","title":"A Walk through AI - Guiding pupils to success through observation of learning processes"},{"location":"1-Mooc/module-1-using-AI-and-Education/1-1-are-teachers-really-concerned-by-Artificial-Intelligence/1-1-2-guiding-pupils.html#video-n2-a-walk-through-ai-guiding-pupils-to-success-through-observation-of-learning-processes","text":"Watch the video below (3'10\")","title":"Video n\u00b02: A Walk through AI - Guiding pupils to success through observation of learning processes"},{"location":"1-Mooc/module-1-using-AI-and-Education/1-1-are-teachers-really-concerned-by-Artificial-Intelligence/1-1-3-learning-analytics.html","text":"Metadata Id: EU.AI4T.O1.M1.1.3v Title: 1.1.3 Video: A Walk through AI - Learning Analytics Type: video Description: Video 3 A Walk through AI - Learning Analytics Subject: Artificial Intelligence for and by Teachers Authors: AI4T Anne, Boyer - Loria Armelle, Brun - Loria Azim, Roussanaly - Loria Guilherme, Medeiros-Machado - Loria Licence: CC BY 4.0 Date: 2022-11-15 A walk through Artificial Intelligence: Learning Analytics \u00b6 Video n\u00b03: A walk through Artificial Intelligence: Learning Analytics \u00b6 Watch the video below (2'40\") Conclusion \u00b6 Artificial intelligence is already a reality in our daily lives and can help us to personalise learning as well as meet other teachers\u2019 expectations by offering learning assistance, support, and facilitation tools.

Examples of activities in education domain that are already being experimented in classrooms and supported by AI technologies include: Step-by-step personalised learning Dynamic clustering of learners for more effective classwork Analysis of student writing and automatic assessment Student-support chatbots Automatic test generation Monitoring of student learning outcomes Administrative tasks like class timetabling or answering common queries To these few examples, could be added a long list of tools now integrated in the teacher and pupil everyday lives when using digital services, like automatic spelling correction, recommendations and suggested reading, email spam filter, automatic voice or face recognition, etc. If we consider the only specific education-oriented tasks, a set of four needs-based categories of emerging and potential applications have been defined by Fengchun & al. 1 : Education management and delivery; Learning and assessment; Empowering teachers and enhancing teaching; And lifelong learning.

Different types of current AI-based systems for Education (from Holmes & al. 2019) AI-related Challenges and Education \u00b6 These emerging AI-technologies also have to be questioned in the context of education use. To harness the opportunities and mitigate the potential risks of AI in education, the following challenges have been identified in Fengchun & al. UNESCO report, 2021: How can AI be leveraged to enhance education? \" Over the past decade, the use of AI tools to support or enhance learning has grown exponentially 3 . This has only increased following the COVID-19 school closures. However, evidence remains scarce on how AI can improve learning outcomes and whether it can help learning scientists and practitioners to better understand how effective learning happens 4 . Furthermore, we have yet to explore AI's potential in the tracking of learning outcomes across different settings as well as assessing competencies, especially those acquired in non-formal and informal contexts. \" \" There is also potential for AI to facilitate new approaches to assessment, such as AI-enabled adaptive and continuous assessment 5 . However, it is important to acknowledge at the outset that the use of AI for learning and assessment also raises various concerns that are yet to be properly addressed. These include concerns about their approach to pedagogy, the lack of robust evidence for their efficacy and potential impact on teachers' roles, and broader ethical questions 6 7 .\" \" Many teacher-facing AI applications aim to help teachers reduce workloads by automating tasks such as assessment, plagiarism detection, administration and feedback. This, it is often argued, should free up time for teachers to invest in other tasks, such as providing more effective support to individual students. \" How can we ensure the ethical, inclusive and equitable use of AI in education? \" The ethical, inclusive and equitable use of AI in education impacts upon each of the Sustainable Development Goals. There are issues centred on data and algorithms, on pedagogical choices, on inclusion and the 'digital divide', on children's right to privacy, liberty and unhindered development, and on equity in terms of gender, disability, social and economic status, ethnic and cultural background, and geographic location. \" How can education prepare humans to live and work with AI? \" If the world is to ensure that AI does not exacerbate existing inequalities, it will be increasingly important for every citizen to have the opportunity to develop a robust understanding of AI -- what it is, how it works, and how it might impact on their lives. This is sometimes called 'AI literacy'. For this, teachers will play a key role. \" \" Helping students learn how to live effectively in a world increasingly impacted by AI requires a pedagogy that puts more emphasis on human skills (e.g. critical thinking, communication, collaboration and creativity) and the ability to collaborate with pervasive AI tools in life, learning, and work. \" Core Competencies Required in the AI Era \u00b6 The deployment of AI-based technologies in school raise questions about the impact of the use of such systems on teaching skills, pointed out by the Joint Research Centre (JRC), the European Commission's science and knowledge service 8 : To what extent should the teacher or user be aware of the underlying technology? How much knowledge should educators have about AI to allow them to act in an informed and effective way as educators? Will today's emerging technologies impact the teaching professional skills in the future? The authors of the Joint Research Center report emphasise that, in addition to general pedagogical knowledge, subject-specific knowledge and classroom management skills, educators will need: General digital competences to use and apply digital technologies as for any citizen 9 regarding Information and digital literacy,Communication and collaboration, Digital content creation, Safety and Problem solving and competences to make valuable educational use of these digital technologies. A specific challenge of introducing AI in education and preparing students for an AI-powered context was presented by UNESCO in 2019 10 : \" To prepare teachers for an AI-powered education while preparing AI to understand education, though this must nevertheless be a two-way road: teachers must learn new digital skills to use AI in a pedagogical and meaningful way and AI developers must learn how teachers work and create solutions that are sustainable in real-life environments. \" In the following modules of this online course, we intend to help in understanding what is AI and its underlying technologies, in being aware of benefits and risks to act in an informed and effective way as a teacher and in questioning the impact of AI systems on learning, teaching and education.

It is even present in our search engines and on social networks. However, AI is an old scientific discipline, it was officially recognised as a field of research in 1956. The historical timeline presented here highlights the main steps of AI developments from the first concept of a programmable machine by Ada Lovelace in 1837 to the most recent scientific advances in deep learning, applied to image recognition applications for example. What are the main scientific milestones of AI? Click on the image below to discover the details of each scientific milestone! The progress of research in the field of AI will be booming until 1974. Subsequently, as the hoped-for results did not materialise, investors lost interest in the discipline and research in the field began to falter until 1980: this was the first winter of AI. It was the rise in the 1980s of expert systems, which made it possible to reproduce cognitive abilities and to outperform experts in their field, that revived the dynamics of the discipline. But here again, the enthusiasm of funders is waning in the face of slower-than-expected progress, and AI will experience a second winter of about ten year. In the mid-1990s, AI experienced a new boom, propelled - among other things - by the victory of IBM's Deep Blue programme over the chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997. New performances, for example in image recognition, are at the origin of the current enthusiasm for the discipline. Current achievements in artificial intelligence, such as the development of voice assistants, medical imaging analysis or intelligent mechanisms in cars, are the result of the research advances of the last twenty years. In 2022, generative AI (text, sound, image), the theoretical foundations of which date back to the 2010s, are being made available to the general public via dedicated interfaces and are enjoying huge popular success. Since then, they have been used in a wide range of fields (industry, research, education, the arts), but they also raise a number of questions about the consequences of misuse (particularly in the field of teaching and learning) and the role of AI's little hands.","title":"2.2.2 A brief history of AI"},{"location":"1-Mooc/module-2-what-is-meant-by-ai/2-2-what-is-artificial-intelligence-actually/2-2-2-a-brief-history-of-ai.html#a-brief-history-of-ai","text":"Today, artificial intelligence is present in many of the technologies we use every day in our computers, our mobile phones, our watches, our speakers...

Type: text Description: Get a first understanding of AI types Subject: Artificial Intelligence for and by Teachers Authors: AI4T Licence: CC BY 4.0 Date: 2022-11-15 What kind of AI? \u00b6 Many AI types can be found in the literature. Let's see what they refer to. Weak or strong AI? \u00b6 Weak Artificial Intelligence This is the artificial intelligence we know today: it is an algorithm that \"learns\", by adapting its parameters to learning data, and is not endowed with mental and cognitive capacities, but is capable of performing a specific task much more efficiently sometimes than a human being. Strong Artificial Intelligence An artificial intelligence that would be capable of copying human aptitudes (learning, understanding, apprehending, reasoning, making decisions, having a conscience, emotions, etc.). A so-called \"strong\" artificial intelligence, which would be able to be autonomous and versatile in unexpected situations, is a scientific objective. However, at present, there are results that show that this ideal goal of strong artificial intelligence is technically impossible. To date, strong artificial intelligence does not exist, it is a belief. Symbolic or Machine Learning Approach? \u00b6 Within Weak Artificial Intelligence, what do the symbolic or Machine Learning approaches refer to? A symbolic AI approach Also known as \"rule-based\" or \"classical\" AI, it is based on logic and a priori knowledge provided by expert humans. Historically, the symbolic approach is older, corresponding to expert systems, and more recently to the so-called semantic web. A machine learning (or Digital) approach Also known as \"digital\" approach, it is based on data and learning. The numerical or Machine Learning (ML) approach includes artificial neural networks and deep learning when there are several layers of such computing units 1 . It has become effective more recently, and it is this approach that allows us to automatically transcribe texts that we dictate, or to recognise objects in images. It requires a lot of data and is based on statistical approaches. The relationship between artificial intelligence, neural networks and deep learning - Source: AI and education: Guidance for policy-makers, UNESCO, 2021 Supervised or Unsupervised Learning Approach? \u00b6 Within Machine Learning approaches, AI systems come in two flavours depending on the way data is used to train them: 2 Supervised Learning \" Supervised learning refers to the use of labelled data -such as pictures that say whether or not they contain cats- to train algorithms. These approaches devise their own methods of predicting how pictures should be labelled. \" Unsupervised Learning \" Unsupervised learning may be used where good quality labelled data is not available. They excel in finding new clusters and associations within data which might not otherwise have been identified or labelled by humans. Since labels are often incomplete or inaccurate, many applications such as content recommendation systems combine both supervised and unsupervised ML approaches. \" Many artificial intelligence mechanisms today work through supervised learning. To describe how it works, let's imagine that we want to teach an artificial intelligence to recognise a cat in an image. To do this, we will provide a lot of data, namely, many images where a cat can be seen and many images where no cat can be seen, so that the calculation adjusts its parameters in order to give an output value corresponding to the presence or not of the feline. All these images constitute the input data, and the expected result, whether or not there is a cat in the image, the output data. These \"input\" and \"output\" data are the only information provided for its training. The computational mechanism must therefore adjust internal parameters (such as the control knobs of a camera) to determine whether or not there is a cat in the image. The first time, a random and therefore most likely false result will be provided, then little by little the mechanism will observe the errors and by successive trials will adjust the parameters to reduce them. This process is known as machine learning. In fact, many AI applications use ML and almost always some symbolic AI in the background. For example, many chatbot applications are pre-programmed with human-defined rules about how to reply to anticipated questions. And it is a current research topic to see how to combine the symbolic and machine learning approaches.

Type: text Description: Get a first understanding of what data is and how it is used in AI. Subject: Artificial Intelligence for and by Teachers Authors: AI4T Laurent Romary - Inria Licence: CC BY 4.0 Date: 2022-11-15 What is data? \u00b6 Role of data in an AI system \u00b6 In the general digital sense, data corresponds to the information that is used, processed and generated by software in a computer system. There is no AI without data. Data plays a central role in all machine learning processes as it is used for both training and for testing. It also comes in the form of the parameters used for managing the training processes. Finally, the AI system is a combination of a certain software architecture with all the trained parameters, the so-called model, which is also data. Understanding the role of data in AI systems together with the way it is selected, documented and disseminated is essential for being able to assess the behavior of an AI system. This is important in terms of reproducibility or for comparing two different AI systems. In the natural language processing world for instance, the availability of large quantities of spoken and written data is central to the performance of spell checkers, prediction in search engines, or of course machine translation. They are used to build up so-called language models, which feed further processes with statistical representations of word or sentence combinations. The sustainability of AI systems is thus closely dependent upon the data management methods that are deployed in their design. Data for supervised and unsupervised AI system \u00b6 As we have already seen, AI systems come in two flavors depending on the way data is used to train them. Supervised systems rely on the provision of inputs together with the corresponding intended outputs. The training thus consists in teaching the system to generate the most probable output out of unknown inputs. There can be various ways to obtain such data. For instance, an image database where each image is associated with keywords or a collection of digitized documents which have been transcribed by annotators (cf. figure below). Figure: Automatic transcription of a letter by Paul D'Estournelles (courtesy of F. Chiffoleau, Coll. Archives de la Sarthe) AI systems based on unsupervised training will not be designed for a specific behavior but designed to bear the statistical property of the training data. This is the case for instance of language models such as BERT which tend to associate similar positions in a mathematical space to words having the same syntactic or semantic behavior, observed from the provision of a large number of sample sentences for each word. Such models are for instance very good at predicting synonyms or the follow-up words of a given sequence. Sources - selection, documentation, preparation, annotation \u00b6 The design of an AI system is essentially based on the proper design of the data set that is used to train it. Among the various factors that come into place we can cite the relevance of the data for the task at hand, the size of the data that should match the complexity of the AI software architecture --- the more mathematical parameters you have to train, the more data you need --- and the variety of samples that should reflect the complexity of the task. Depending on the data sources, data must be selected and often cleaned up before it is fed into the training process. If we take for instance the training of a language model on the basis of web content, the various samples must be sorted according to the actual language, depleted from the accompanying web code (HTML, Javascript etc.) and possibly shuffled to prevent copyright infringements. A good example of such data preparation is the design of the OSCAR corpus 1 . The design of annotated data for supervised AI systems is more complex as it involves the design of an annotation scheme, the organization of annotation campaigns and the control of the quality of the annotated data for instance by assessing the agreement between annotators on the same data. All in all, it is essential that the design process be well documented to be able to track back to the source of possible failed behaviors in the resulting trained system. Biased AI systems \u00b6 As just alluded to, the behavior of an AI system closely reflects the nature of the data which has been used to train it. This in turn may induce a whole range of possible biases that may result from the underlying selection of data sets. For instance, a language model which is only trained on newspaper articles will cover completely different types of expressions and topics than one for which literature or social networks content has been chosen. In the same way, image generation systems will reflect the size and variety of the source image databases (e.g. artistic works) that have been considered. In the case of supervised systems, a specific bias may come from the way the annotation labels are designed as well as the way the annotators, with their own cultural background, will interpret the data. If for instance you want to identify hate speech on social networks, the way sentiments are interpreted by annotators may vary according to the age,nculture, and personal feelings of the annotators vis-\u00e0-vis the material to be annotated. All in all, one should always keep in mind that AI systems are by construction very conservative with regards to their training data and thus with regards to existing observables. One cannot expect any kind of real creativity from an AI system. Hosting, pooling, distributing data \u00b6 Because of the size and possible complexity of the training data in AI systems as well as the resulting models, various initiatives have been set up to allow for their hosting and distribution. Open data sets and models can be hosted in specialized repositories (ex. the image data resource 2 ) or in generic national or international (e.g. Zenodo 3 ) repositories. Such repositories usually provide the necessary infrastructure for managing authorship, licensing, versioning and archiving of their content.

There is no AI without data. Data plays a central role in all machine learning processes as it is used for both training and for testing. It also comes in the form of the parameters used for managing the training processes. Finally, the AI system is a combination of a certain software architecture with all the trained parameters, the so-called model, which is also data. Understanding the role of data in AI systems together with the way it is selected, documented and disseminated is essential for being able to assess the behavior of an AI system. This is important in terms of reproducibility or for comparing two different AI systems. In the natural language processing world for instance, the availability of large quantities of spoken and written data is central to the performance of spell checkers, prediction in search engines, or of course machine translation. They are used to build up so-called language models, which feed further processes with statistical representations of word or sentence combinations. The sustainability of AI systems is thus closely dependent upon the data management methods that are deployed in their design.","title":"Role of data in an AI system"},{"location":"1-Mooc/module-3-how-does-AI-work/3-2-lets-play-with-the-data/3-2-2-what-is-data.html#data-for-supervised-and-unsupervised-ai-system","text":"As we have already seen, AI systems come in two flavors depending on the way data is used to train them. Supervised systems rely on the provision of inputs together with the corresponding intended outputs. The training thus consists in teaching the system to generate the most probable output out of unknown inputs. There can be various ways to obtain such data. For instance, an image database where each image is associated with keywords or a collection of digitized documents which have been transcribed by annotators (cf. figure below). Figure: Automatic transcription of a letter by Paul D'Estournelles (courtesy of F. Chiffoleau, Coll. Archives de la Sarthe) AI systems based on unsupervised training will not be designed for a specific behavior but designed to bear the statistical property of the training data. This is the case for instance of language models such as BERT which tend to associate similar positions in a mathematical space to words having the same syntactic or semantic behavior, observed from the provision of a large number of sample sentences for each word. Such models are for instance very good at predicting synonyms or the follow-up words of a given sequence.","title":"Data for supervised and unsupervised AI system"},{"location":"1-Mooc/module-3-how-does-AI-work/3-2-lets-play-with-the-data/3-2-2-what-is-data.html#sources-selection-documentation-preparation-annotation","text":"The design of an AI system is essentially based on the proper design of the data set that is used to train it. Among the various factors that come into place we can cite the relevance of the data for the task at hand, the size of the data that should match the complexity of the AI software architecture --- the more mathematical parameters you have to train, the more data you need --- and the variety of samples that should reflect the complexity of the task. Depending on the data sources, data must be selected and often cleaned up before it is fed into the training process. If we take for instance the training of a language model on the basis of web content, the various samples must be sorted according to the actual language, depleted from the accompanying web code (HTML, Javascript etc.) and possibly shuffled to prevent copyright infringements. A good example of such data preparation is the design of the OSCAR corpus 1 . The design of annotated data for supervised AI systems is more complex as it involves the design of an annotation scheme, the organization of annotation campaigns and the control of the quality of the annotated data for instance by assessing the agreement between annotators on the same data. All in all, it is essential that the design process be well documented to be able to track back to the source of possible failed behaviors in the resulting trained system.","title":"Sources - selection, documentation, preparation, annotation"},{"location":"1-Mooc/module-3-how-does-AI-work/3-2-lets-play-with-the-data/3-2-2-what-is-data.html#biased-ai-systems","text":"As just alluded to, the behavior of an AI system closely reflects the nature of the data which has been used to train it. This in turn may induce a whole range of possible biases that may result from the underlying selection of data sets. For instance, a language model which is only trained on newspaper articles will cover completely different types of expressions and topics than one for which literature or social networks content has been chosen. In the same way, image generation systems will reflect the size and variety of the source image databases (e.g. artistic works) that have been considered. In the case of supervised systems, a specific bias may come from the way the annotation labels are designed as well as the way the annotators, with their own cultural background, will interpret the data. If for instance you want to identify hate speech on social networks, the way sentiments are interpreted by annotators may vary according to the age,nculture, and personal feelings of the annotators vis-\u00e0-vis the material to be annotated. All in all, one should always keep in mind that AI systems are by construction very conservative with regards to their training data and thus with regards to existing observables.

The result (output) is well adapted to the type of data chosen. Tensor flow playground view TensorFlow: Some explanations before trying the simulation of a neural network \u00b6 Source: translation from Pixees French web site What is a neural network and how does it work? A neural network is a generic mechanism composed of small units (pseudo-neurons) connected to each other. Each unit performs a very simple operation: it takes input values, combines them very simply (a simple averaging with coefficients) and applies a transformation on the result (e.g. keeps only positive values). The coefficients used to weight the average are the parameters of this algorithm. It is the combination of a very, very large number of these units that allows very complex operations to be performed. A network of such \"neurons\" is obtained by accumulating several layers of such units. The input is the data that we want to process. They are transformed through all the layers and the last layer gives as output a prediction on this data, for example to detect if there is a face in an image. The neural network is thus a parameterized function with many coefficients (called \"weights\") and it is the choice of these weights that defines the processing carried out. Where are the neurons in TensorFlow? On the TensorFlow web interface, a network of a dozen neurons, each with between 3 and 10 parameters, can easily be created. The calculated output thus depends on hundreds of parameters in addition to the two coordinates (x,y) of the input point. On the interface, each square represents a neuron and the colour of the pixel of coordinates (x,y) in the square represents the output of the neuron when we put (x,y) in input of the network. If there is only one neuron at the output, it is represented with a larger square on the right of the network. The parameters of the network are initialized with random values. But how do you learn these weights? Supervised learning consists of providing examples of data with the solution to be found in order to train the network to adjust these weights as required. In the example in the figure above, it is a series of points in a square, each with an expected colour (blue or orange), with the aim of predicting the colour of the point at a given location. A classical algorithm of progressive adjustment of the weights is used to find the parameters in question. The \"play\" button at the top left of the interface is used to launch this algorithm, and the output of the neural network is then seen to evolve during the \"learning\" process: the background colour of the output neuron tends to take on the colour of the training points that are drawn over it. Another part of the dataset is then used to test the quality of the resulting function of the network. A curve at the top right shows the error rate of the data used for learning (to check that the weights have adjusted properly) and the error rate of the other test data (to check that what has been learned generalises well to new data). Buttons on the left side allow to adjust the distribution of the data between the training and the test set and also to add errors to the data (noisy data) to see if the mechanism is robust to these errors. In practice, we manage to find satisfactory parameters, but there is no real theoretical framework for formalising all this, it's a matter of experimentation: choosing the right number of neurons, the right number of layers of neurons, what preliminary calculations to add as input (for example multiplying the inputs to increase the degrees of freedom for the calculation). These kinds of techniques can produce impressive results in practice, such as in voice or object recognition in an image. However, understanding why (and how) such good results are obtained is still a fairly open scientific question.

Type: text Description: Identify the different types of risks Subject: Artificial Intelligence for and by Teachers Authors: AI4T Licence: CC BY 4.0 Date: 2022-11-15 Where Does the Risk Come From? \u00b6 In its study about Artificial Intelligence 1 , the European Parliamentary Research Service stated: \" It is important to note that AI algorithms cannot be objective because, just like people, in the course of their training they develop a way of making sense of what they have seen before, and use this 'worldview' to categorise new situations with which they are presented. \" Let's see where the subjectivity of an AI comes from and what are the associated risks. The bias in data and in algorithms \u00b6 As for any digital system, the data used in AI-based platforms come from different sources and have multiple formats. They carry different types of bias 2 . Data bias is mainly statistical. Let's list a few of them. Sample bias is typically present in data values. For example, this is the case for a recruitment algorithm trained on a database in which men are overrepresented will exclude women. Stereotype bias is a tendency to act in reference to the social group we belong to. For example, one study shows that women tend to click on job offers that they think are easier to get as a woman. Omitted variable bias (modelling or coding bias) is a bias due to the difficulty of representing or coding a factor in the data. For example, because it is difficult to find factual criteria to measure emotional intelligence, this dimension is absent from recruitment algorithms. The selection bias is in turn due to the characteristics of the sample selected to draw conclusions. For example, a bank will use internal data to derive a credit score, focusing on those who have or have not obtained a loan, but ignoring those who have never needed to borrow, etc. The algorithmic bias is mainly a matter of reasoning. Such bias is introduced by AI engineers deliberately or not. The previously mentioned European Parliamentary Research Service study gives two concrete examples: \" Consider a symbolic AI algorithm for examining job applications. It might evaluate candidates by assigning scores only on the basis of their education and experience. Yet, if it fails to take account of factors such as maternity leave or to appropriately recognise education in foreign institutions in ways that human selection committees would, the algorithm might discriminate against women and foreign candidates. \" \" Now, consider a similar AI tool within the ML (Machine Learning) paradigm. Such algorithms find their own ways of identifying which kind of candidates were selected in their training data. Where there is a history of structural biases in these selections -- for example racial discrimination -- the algorithm can learn these. Even where data about nationality or ethnicity is removed from the data, ML is adept at finding proxies for underlying patterns in other data such as languages, postcodes or schools that can be good predictors of ethnicity. \" The three facets of algorithmic risk \u00b6 The algorithmic risk can be characterised in three ways 3 . Firstly, there is algorithmic confinement , which can also relate to opinions, cultural knowledge or even commercial practices. Indeed, the algorithms confront the Internet user with the same content, depending on his profile and the integrated parameters, despite the respect of the principle of fairness. This is the case on news recommendation sites such as Facebook or product recommendation sites such as Amazon. The second facet of algorithmic risk is linked to the control of all aspects of an individual's life , from the regulation of information for investors to his or her eating habits, hobbies, or even health status. This tracing of the individual suggests a form of surveillance that contravenes the very essence of individual freedom. The third is related to the potential violation of fundamental rights . In particular, algorithmic discrimination defined as unfavourable or unequal treatment, in comparison with other persons or other equal or similar situations, based on a ground expressly prohibited by law. This encompasses the study of the fairness ( fairness ) of ranking (sorting of people looking for a job online), recommendation, and prediction learning algorithms. The problem of discriminatory bias induced by algorithms concerns several areas such as online hiring, court decisions, police patrol decisions, or school admissions.

For example, an AI tool dedicated to foreign language teaching can help to propose the right exercise at the right time. The task likely to be most relevant to a student 's next stage of learning is decided by the AI tool using a combination of Hermann Ebbinghaus' \"forgetting curve\" and the student's model (obtained by tracking the statistics of each word already taught). It's how Duolingo for Schools works, for example. In order to better understand how AI can transform the way decisions are made, it should be remembered that there are three main degrees of involvement of AI in decision making 1 : In Decision automation, the system makes the decision using prescriptive analytics or predictive analytics. Its benefits include speed, scalability and consistency of decision making. In Decision augmentation, the system recommends a decision, or multiple decision alternatives, to human actors using prescriptive or predictive analytics. Its benefits lie in the synergy between human knowledge and the capability of AI to rapidly analyse high volumes of data and to deal with complexity. In Decision support, Human person makes the decision , supported by descriptive, diagnostic or predictive analytics. Its main benefit lies in the combined application of data-driven insights and human knowledge, expertise and common sense, including \"gut feel\" and emotions. And each degree can cover very different realities. For example, decision automation can be used for a wide range of purposes. When an exercise or task is given to a student in regards to its profile by a learning app using AI, it's decision automation. In the case of Duolingo for schools , a specific student will be given a task implying words he might be on the verge of forgetting or exercises he could succeed because it is situated in his proximal zone of development. In these cases, the decision made by the AI may be the most relevant and its potential harm seems rather small. But if an AI system were to propose a legal decision on the basis of a dataset consisting of a series of previous decisions, the implication of this delegation of decision-making to AI has another set of consequences. So, classifying decisions in degrees related to the level of AI implied is not sufficient to understand the role played by AI in changing the way decisions are made.

It is reminded that \" While most AI systems pose limited to no risk and can contribute to solving many societal challenges, certain AI systems create risks that we must address to avoid undesirable outcomes \". With a focus on the fact that \" it is often not possible to find out why an AI system has made a decision or prediction and taken a particular action. So, it may become difficult to assess whether someone has been unfairly disadvantaged, such as in a hiring decision or in an application for a public benefit scheme\" . Four levels of risk were identified, from minimal to unacceptable: Unacceptable risk : All AI systems considered a clear threat to the safety, livelihoods and rights of people will be banned, from social scoring by governments to toys using voice assistance that encourages dangerous behaviour. High risk : AI systems identified as high-risk include AI technology used in: Critical infrastructures (e.g. transport), that could put the life and health of citizens at risk; Educational or vocational training, that may determine the access to education and professional course of someone's life (e.g. scoring of exams) ; Safety components of products (e.g. AI application in robot-assisted surgery); Employment, management of workers and access to self-employment (e.g. CV-sorting software for recruitment procedures); Essential private and public services (e.g. credit scoring denying citizens opportunity to obtain a loan); Law enforcement that may interfere with people's fundamental rights (e.g. evaluation of the reliability of evidence); Migration, asylum and border control management (e.g. verification of authenticity of travel documents); Administration of justice and democratic processes (e.g. applying the law to a concrete set of facts). Limited risk : Limited risk refers to AI systems with specific transparency obligations. When using AI systems such as chatbots, users should be aware that they are interacting with a machine so they can take an informed decision to continue or step back. Minimal or no risk : The proposal allows the free use of minimal-risk AI. This includes applications such as AI-enabled video games or spam filters. The vast majority of AI systems currently used in the EU fall into this category. The proposed 4 levels of Artificial Intelligence risks of the AI Act of the EC. The classification of educational and vocational training in the high-risk category does not mean that no AI system should be used in those fields but that extra precautions are to be taken.

It is reminded that \" While most AI systems pose limited to no risk and can contribute to solving many societal challenges, certain AI systems create risks that we must address to avoid undesirable outcomes \". With a focus on the fact that \" it is often not possible to find out why an AI system has made a decision or prediction and taken a particular action. So, it may become difficult to assess whether someone has been unfairly disadvantaged, such as in a hiring decision or in an application for a public benefit scheme\" . Four levels of risk were identified, from minimal to unacceptable: Unacceptable risk : All AI systems considered a clear threat to the safety, livelihoods and rights of people will be banned, from social scoring by governments to toys using voice assistance that encourages dangerous behaviour. High risk : AI systems identified as high-risk include AI technology used in: Critical infrastructures (e.g. transport), that could put the life and health of citizens at risk; Educational or vocational training, that may determine the access to education and professional course of someone's life (e.g. scoring of exams) ; Safety components of products (e.g. AI application in robot-assisted surgery); Employment, management of workers and access to self-employment (e.g. CV-sorting software for recruitment procedures); Essential private and public services (e.g. credit scoring denying citizens opportunity to obtain a loan); Law enforcement that may interfere with people's fundamental rights (e.g. evaluation of the reliability of evidence); Migration, asylum and border control management (e.g. verification of authenticity of travel documents); Administration of justice and democratic processes (e.g. applying the law to a concrete set of facts). Limited risk : Limited risk refers to AI systems with specific transparency obligations. When using AI systems such as chatbots, users should be aware that they are interacting with a machine so they can take an informed decision to continue or step back. Minimal or no risk : The proposal allows the free use of minimal-risk AI. This includes applications such as AI-enabled video games or spam filters. The vast majority of AI systems currently used in the EU fall into this category. The proposed 4 levels of Artificial Intelligence risks of the AI Act of the EC. The classification of educational and vocational training in the high-risk category does not mean that no AI system should be used in those fields but that extra precautions are to be taken.

AI and Medicine \u00b6 \" AI is indeed at the heart of the medicine of the future with assisted operations, remote patient monitoring, intelligent prostheses, or even personalised treatments thanks to the cross-referencing of data (bigdata) .\" 1 About 50 years ago, it's in the field of diagnosis that one of the most well-known expert system was developed: MYCIN. \" It was an early expert system that used artificial intelligence to identify bacteria causing severe infections, such as bacteraemia and meningitis, and to recommend antibiotics, with the dosage adjusted for patient's body weight \" 2 . Developed from 1972, MYCIN was able, 6 years later, to outperform doctors in establishing accurate diagnoses. In a full-scale test, MYCIN and 9 doctors, interns and academics, are asked to carry out diagnoses and perform prescriptions on 80 patients with meningitis.

In a nutshell, it involves feeding software thousands of examples so that it learns to carry out identification tasks, e.g. looking through images to identify dogs or cats. Beauty spots or malignant melanomas. In theory, this should open up a wide range of applications in medicine. For example, x-rays are collected from thousands of patients suffering from the same condition - what is known as a cohort. Then, using this machine learning data, the computer will detect the same visual characteristics in any new images taken during screening for other individuals. This becomes the target data .\" 4 AI and Justice \u00b6 In the field of justice, two main uses of AI systems are identified. First are the tools that can help in the decision-making process. An AI system can assist a judge in the investigation of a case, for example, by informing him or her of all the judgments handed down by relevant courts in similar cases. In this case, AI enhances the information search but the decision is made by the judge on his/her own 5 . Then there are tools that can predict decisions. In this case, AI proposes directly to the judge a court decision 6 . The software analyses a large number of examples of court decisions and \"automatically\" derives decision rules. The emergence of predictive justice is raising many concerns. If \" The application of AI in the field of justice can contribute to improve the efficiency and quality \" [it] \" must be implemented in a responsible manner which complies with the fundamental rights \" 7 . On the European level, an Ethical Charter on the Use of Artificial Intelligence in Judicial Systems and their environment was adopted in 2018. Organised around 5 principles, it recognises the importance of non-discrimination, respect of fundamental rights, non-discrimination, quality, security, transparency, impartiality and fairness. It finally stresses out the \"under user control\" principle: \" precluding a prescriptive approach and ensuring that users are informed actors and in control of their choices .\" 7 In Law as in Education or Medicine, decision support from the AI system can improve the decision made. In regard to the potential consequences of these same decisions, maintaining human oversight is an important issue for AI system development in the coming years. Any user of those has to be able to keep critical use of the proposition of decision made by AI systems. For example, in the detection of certain cancers, the systems are so well trained on certain visual features that they make excellent diagnostics on these manifestations but are no longer able to recognise the others. There is still a need for a doctor's eye to see what missed the well-trained AI.

For some automated decisions, such as the \"solution steps\" suggested to a student by a mathematical problem-solving application, the long-term risk and harm can be considered rather low. Other decisions, on the contrary, present a potential harm and/or risk. There is then a maximum of precautions to be taken and first of all the decision must be explainable (why this decision is proposed for this particular situation, for this particular student or group of students). Let's see some criteria that are used to \"evaluate\" the decision-making process of AI-based systems. Explainability \u00b6 Explainability - one of the 7 key requirements for trustworthy AI: \" Explainability concerns the ability to explain both the technical processes of an AI system and the related human decisions (e.g. application areas of a system). Technical explainability requires that the decisions made by an AI system can be understood and traced by human beings. \" 1 In the field of education, this means that in any AI decision-making tool, the way a decision is proposed and the human interaction involved are elements that need to be accessed. This requirement is more or less easy to meet, but for some AI technologies the explainability is not so simple to provide. For example, in the case of neural networks with many layers, explanations can be difficult to render. So that a new area of AI is now developing: eXplainable AI or XAI defined as an artificial intelligence in which humans can understand the decisions or predictions made by the AI. It contrasts with the \"black box\" concept in machine learning where even its designers cannot explain why an AI arrived at a specific decision. \" 2 Interpretability \u00b6 Predictions made with some AI techniques are easier to interpret than others. A prediction made from a decision tree, for example, is explainable. But it is not always the most interesting predictions to be made. At the opposite end of the explainability spectrum, there is Deep learning, which can be difficult to explain but whose output may be much more significant than those made with highly explainable AI. Figure1: AI mechanisms and interpretability. Adapted from Mooc IAI / Ikram Chraibi Kaadoud - CC.BY.SA 2.0. Thus, the decision support provided by tools with low interpretability can be more significant than the support provided by tools with high interpretability. From description to prescription \u00b6 Here is a representation that relates the technology used, its complexity and its strategic outcome. Figure 2: Classification of data analysis use from description to prescription 3 (Adapted from the \"Learning Analytics\" video of this course). In the following 4 categories the correlation between the complexity of the methods used and the strategic results can be noted. Descriptive Analytics \u00b6 Descriptive Analytics looks into data to answer the question \"What happened?\". Those can be provided in the form of \" simple summaries about the sample and about the observations that have been made. Such summaries may be either quantitative or visual, i.e. simple-to-understand graphs \" 4 . It is based on traditional tools without AI. Diagnostic Analytics \u00b6 Diagnostic Analytics answers the question, \"Why did it happen?\". It leads to the identification of the nature and cause of a phenomenon to determine the mitigations, and solutions. Some techniques used for diagnostic analytics: Statistics methods like data discovery, data mining and correlations. Those methods can imply AI. Predictive Analytics \u00b6 Predictive Analytics examines data or events to answer the question \"What is going to happen?\" or more precisely, \"What is likely to happen?\". \" Predictive analytics is forward-looking, using past events to anticipate the future. Predictive analytics statistical techniques include data modelling, machine learning, AI, deep learning algorithms and data mining. \" 5 Prescriptive Analytics \u00b6 Prescriptive Analytics answers the question \"What should be done?\" or \"How can we make it happen?\". \" Prescriptive analytics not only anticipates what will happen and when it will happen, but also why it will happen. Further, prescriptive analytics suggests decision options on how to take advantage of a future opportunity or mitigate a future risk and shows the implication of each decision option .\" 6 In summary, the more relevant the tools can be as an aid to decision making, the more complex the information technologies are and the more difficult they can be to explain. But in terms of the assistance provided, attention must be maintained on explicability and any vigilance required in the use of the IA tool in an area where the consequences of decisions are significant and lasting. \" Moreover, trade-offs might have to be made between enhancing a system's explainability (which may reduce its accuracy) or increasing its accuracy (at the cost of explainability). Whenever an AI system has a significant impact on people's lives, it should be possible to demand a suitable explanation of the AI system's decision-making process. Such explanation should be timely and adapted to the expertise of the stakeholder concerned (e.g. layperson, regulator or researcher). In addition, explanations of the degree to which an AI system influences and shapes the organisational decision-making process, design choices of the system, and the rationale for deploying it, should be available (hence ensuring business model transparency). \" From \"Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI\" (consulted 10/16/2022). \u21a9 From wikipedia article on \"Explainable artificial intelligence\" (consulted 10/16/2022). \u21a9 See in this course the section 1.1.3. on Learning analytics (video). \u21a9 From wikipedia article on \"Descriptive statistics\" (consulted 10/16/2022). \u21a9 From wikipedia article on \"Predictive Analytics\" (consulted 10/16/2022). \u21a9 From wikipedia article on \"Prescriptive Analytics\" (consulted 10/16/2022). \u21a9","title":"4.2.1 Ready to trust AI for decision making?"},{"location":"1-Mooc/module-4-AI-at-our-service-as-teachers/4-2-imagine-teaching-with-ai/4-2-1-are-you-ready-to-trust-ai-for-decision-making.html#are-you-ready-to-trust-ai-for-decision-making","text":"All decisions made with AI-based tools do not have all the same impact.

Whenever an AI system has a significant impact on people's lives, it should be possible to demand a suitable explanation of the AI system's decision-making process. Such explanation should be timely and adapted to the expertise of the stakeholder concerned (e.g. layperson, regulator or researcher). In addition, explanations of the degree to which an AI system influences and shapes the organisational decision-making process, design choices of the system, and the rationale for deploying it, should be available (hence ensuring business model transparency). \" From \"Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI\" (consulted 10/16/2022). \u21a9 From wikipedia article on \"Explainable artificial intelligence\" (consulted 10/16/2022). \u21a9 See in this course the section 1.1.3. on Learning analytics (video). \u21a9 From wikipedia article on \"Descriptive statistics\" (consulted 10/16/2022). \u21a9 From wikipedia article on \"Predictive Analytics\" (consulted 10/16/2022). \u21a9 From wikipedia article on \"Prescriptive Analytics\" (consulted 10/16/2022). \u21a9","title":"Prescriptive Analytics"},{"location":"1-Mooc/module-4-AI-at-our-service-as-teachers/4-3-artificial-intelligence-at-our-service/4-3-1v-artificial-intelligence-at-our-service.html","text":"Metadata Id: EU.AI4T.O1.M4.3.1v Title: 4.3.1 Video: Artificial Intelligence at our Service?

Particularly in view of their many implications for education. 1 - Understanding ChatGPT \u00b6 To give you a better idea of what these language models are, The AI4T team wante dto share with you the work of the Flowers team (Inria Centre at the University of Bordeaux) which carries out scientific research in the field of developmental artificial intelligence. In particular, it is interested in computer modelling of human learning mechanisms, and the role of curiosity and language in cognitive development. It is also studying the properties of the major language models (ChatGPT, Mistral, etc), and developing methods that will enable them to be better anchored in the real world. The team is also studying applications of this work in the field of educational technologies, as well as to help scientists (physicists, biologists, etc.) explore and better understand new systems (materials, self-organising chemical reactions, etc.). Episode#1: How do language models work? \u00b6 \u00ab How does ChatGPT work? An overview in less than 5 minutes \u00bb (in English) Synopsis: This video is an introduction to large language models which are the basis for tools like ChatGPT or Bard. They are intended for the general public (for instance students and professors in middle and high school, and more generally anyone not accustomed to computer science or AI). This is a 5-minute overview answering these questions: - How are these models \"trained\"? - On which type and amount of data are they trained, and what is the impact of the size of the training corpus? - Which types of tasks are they capable of doing, and how can we ask them to perform those tasks? - What are their main usages in society? - What are their limitations and biases? What social issues? - Which organizations develop these models? Are there \"open-sourced\" ones ?. It's aimed at a wide audience, including students and teachers in secondary schools. Episode#2: How to get a language model to perform a task? \u00b6 \u00ab Prompting, or the art of making yourself understood by ChatGPT: Explained in 5 minutes \u00bb (in English) Synopsis: Language Models, such as ChatGPT or Bard, have demonstrated impressive capabilities for a wide range of tasks. However, they also have numerous limitations and weaknesses! In this video, we explain the main ones: - Language Models are trained on data of varying quality and origin. The selection of this data is often not precisely controlled. - This data, and thus the Language Models, can contain \"biases\", meaning an automatic way of thinking that is not based on reasoning or facts. These biases can be unfair and reinforce stereotypes. If these biases are not controlled, they will be reflected in the output and usage of these models. ... Episode#3: Limits and weaknesses of language models \u00b6 \u00ab What are the limits of ChatGPT? Explained in 5 minutes \u00bb (in English) Synopsis: Language models such as ChatGPT or Bard have shown impressive capabilities for a wide variety of tasks. However, they also have many limitations and weaknesses! Episode#4: The strengths of language models \u00b6 \u00ab The strengths of language models \u00bb (in French - English version soon available) Synopsis: This video presents the main strengths of language models such as ChatGPT or Bard. Despite certain weaknesses, they also possess a large number of strengths, such as : - their ability to analyze a given context to provide an appropriate response to a task - their use of external tools (e.g. Wikipedia) - the wide range of data on which they have been trained - their ability to produce basic reasoning - their \"common sense\" in certain contexts - their ability to help us come up with creative ideas Episode#5 : advanced prompting and reasoning \u00b6 \u00ab Advanced prompting and reasoning \u00bb (in French - English version soon available) Synopsis : This video shows how language models such as ChatGPT or Bard are able to hold simple reasonings to solve a given problem. However, it is sometimes necessary to use various advanced prompts techniques to help them organise such reasoning. Some of these techniques (e.g. thought chains) are presented here; then the origin and limits of these reasoning abilities are discussed. Episode#6 : Language model applications \u00b6 \u00ab Language model applications \u00bb (in French) Synopsis : Language models such as ChatGPT or Bard are becoming increasingly powerful and are being used in more and more areas. In this video, we look at the possible applications of these tools in areas such as work, health, education and language preservation.

In particular, it is interested in computer modelling of human learning mechanisms, and the role of curiosity and language in cognitive development. It is also studying the properties of the major language models (ChatGPT, Mistral, etc), and developing methods that will enable them to be better anchored in the real world. The team is also studying applications of this work in the field of educational technologies, as well as to help scientists (physicists, biologists, etc.) explore and better understand new systems (materials, self-organising chemical reactions, etc.).","title":"1 - Understanding ChatGPT"},{"location":"2-Project-resources/1-AI-and-Education-Tools/4-ChatGPT-and-Language-model.html#episode1-how-do-language-models-work","text":"\u00ab How does ChatGPT work? An overview in less than 5 minutes \u00bb (in English) Synopsis: This video is an introduction to large language models which are the basis for tools like ChatGPT or Bard. They are intended for the general public (for instance students and professors in middle and high school, and more generally anyone not accustomed to computer science or AI). This is a 5-minute overview answering these questions: - How are these models \"trained\"? - On which type and amount of data are they trained, and what is the impact of the size of the training corpus? - Which types of tasks are they capable of doing, and how can we ask them to perform those tasks? - What are their main usages in society? - What are their limitations and biases? What social issues? - Which organizations develop these models? Are there \"open-sourced\" ones ?.

However, they also have numerous limitations and weaknesses! In this video, we explain the main ones: - Language Models are trained on data of varying quality and origin. The selection of this data is often not precisely controlled. - This data, and thus the Language Models, can contain \"biases\", meaning an automatic way of thinking that is not based on reasoning or facts. These biases can be unfair and reinforce stereotypes. If these biases are not controlled, they will be reflected in the output and usage of these models. ...","title":"Episode#2: How to get a language model to perform a task?"},{"location":"2-Project-resources/1-AI-and-Education-Tools/4-ChatGPT-and-Language-model.html#episode3-limits-and-weaknesses-of-language-models","text":"\u00ab What are the limits of ChatGPT?

Enhancing Understanding with Easy-to-Read and Understand (FALC) \u00b6 Principle: FALC (in french Facile \u00e0 Lire et \u00e0 Comprendre, in english easy to read and understand ) simplifies vocabulary, syntax, and text formatting to make content accessible to students with reading or comprehension difficulties or cognitive disabilities. AI can automate this reformulation while preserving the educational meaning. Application example: A teacher can ask an AI to reformulate exercise instructions or project steps according to FALC principles, improving clarity and comprehension for all students. Diversifying Learning Materials \u00b6 Principle: AI enables the delivery of content in multiple formats according to learner needs and preferences: text, image, audio, or video. This approach supports attention, autonomy, and equal access to information. Application example: From a single lesson, an AI can generate an audio version for dyslexic students, a visual diagram for visual learners, or a simplified summary for students requiring comprehension support. Training and Supporting Teachers \u00b6 Principle: The effectiveness of AI for inclusion also depends on teacher training and approach. It can be used for self-training, adjusting communication, or redesigning course materials inclusively. AI can also facilitate clearer, more considerate communication. Application example: A teacher can use AI to reformulate a message for a student or family to make it more accessible, or to adapt an activity without disrupting group dynamics.

Where no substitution is possible: maintenance of the original resource in english (as for example, documents as the AI Watch, JRC publications, aso.) Where an alternative resource exists, it can be listed alongside the original resource. In order to be as close as possible to the local context, the addition of references in the target languages is recommended. Reminder about translation quality /accuracy The translated text are generated by DeepL from one version of the Mooc (we recommand using the english version as a base for further translation). Adjustments to improve the quality of the translation may be required and first proofreading must be carried out; sometimes DeepL interprets signs (such as \"*\") incorrectly and there may be discrepancies in the translation (one or more elements of the text have remained in the source language). A first \"formal clean-up\" of the translation is therefore useful before moving on to the substantive proofreading.","title":"3.2.2 Step 2.2 - Proofreading Texts"},{"location":"3-Build-your-own-training/3-2-Step-2-Translating-the-mooc-resources/3-2-2-Step-2-2.html#where-to-find-the-texts-of-the-mooc-to-proofread-and-correct","text":"All texts, images and activities of the 4 Modules with Presentation and Conclusion Modules are available in the GitHub repository you have created in Step 2-1: \"Creating and translating texts\" ).

Voyons \u00e0 quoi ils font r\u00e9f\u00e9rence. Intelligence artificielle faible ou forte ? \u00b6 Intelligence artificielle faible C'est l'intelligence artificielle que nous connaissons aujourd'hui : c'est un algorithme qui \"apprend\", en adaptant ses param\u00e8tres aux donn\u00e9es d'apprentissage, et qui n'est pas dot\u00e9 de capacit\u00e9s mentales et cognitives, mais qui est capable d'effectuer une t\u00e2che sp\u00e9cifique de mani\u00e8re beaucoup plus efficace (rapidit\u00e9, pr\u00e9cision) parfois qu'un \u00eatre humain. Intelligence artificielle forte Une intelligence artificielle qui serait capable de copier les aptitudes humaines (apprendre, comprendre, appr\u00e9hender, raisonner, prendre des d\u00e9cisions, avoir une conscience, des \u00e9motions...). D\u00e9velopper une intelligence artificielle dite \"forte\", qui serait capable d'\u00eatre autonome et polyvalente dans des situations inattendues, est un objectif scientifique. Cependant, \u00e0 l'heure actuelle, certains r\u00e9sultats montrent que cet objectif id\u00e9al d'intelligence artificielle forte est techniquement impossible. \u00c0 ce jour, l'intelligence artificielle forte n'existe pas. Approche symbolique ou apprentissage automatique ? \u00b6 Au sein de l'intelligence artificielle faible, \u00e0 quoi font r\u00e9f\u00e9rence les approches symbolique ou d'apprentissage automatique ? Une approche d'IA symbolique Aussi appel\u00e9e IA \"\u00e0 base de r\u00e8gles\" ou \"classique\", elle est bas\u00e9e sur la logique et les connaissances a priori fournies par des humains experts du domaine \u00e9tudi\u00e9. Historiquement, l'approche symbolique est plus ancienne, correspondant aux syst\u00e8mes experts, et plus r\u00e9cemment au web dit s\u00e9mantique. Une approche par l'apprentissage automatique (ou num\u00e9rique) \u00c9galement appel\u00e9e approche \"num\u00e9rique\", elle est bas\u00e9e sur les donn\u00e9es et l'apprentissage. L'approche num\u00e9rique ou Machine Learning (ML) comprend les r\u00e9seaux de neurones artificiels et l'apprentissage profond lorsqu'il y a plusieurs couches de ces unit\u00e9s de calcul 1 . Elle est devenue efficace plus r\u00e9cemment suite \u00e0 des avanc\u00e9es technologiques concernant la vitesse et l'architecture des processeurs dont ceux graphiques et avec des calculs dans le nuage. Cette approche permet, par exemple, de transcrire automatiquement les textes que nous dictons, ou de reconna\u00eetre et de traiter des voix et des objets dans des images.

Ces donn\u00e9es \"d'entr\u00e9e\" et \"de sortie\" sont les seules informations fournies pour son apprentissage. Le m\u00e9canisme de calcul doit donc ajuster des param\u00e8tres internes (comme les boutons de r\u00e9glage d'un appareil photo) pour d\u00e9terminer s'il y a ou non un chat dans l'image.

Type: text Description: Une premi\u00e8re compr\u00e9hension de ce qu'est une donn\u00e9e et comment elle est utilis\u00e9e en IA. Subject: Artificial Intelligence for and by Teachers Authors: AI4T Laurent Romary - Inria Licence: CC BY 4.0 Date: 2022-11-15 Qu'est-ce qu'une donn\u00e9e ? \u00b6 R\u00f4le des donn\u00e9es dans un syst\u00e8me d'IA \u00b6 Au sens num\u00e9rique g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, les donn\u00e9es correspondent aux informations qui sont utilis\u00e9es, trait\u00e9es et g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9es par les logiciels d'un syst\u00e8me informatique. Il n'y a pas d'IA sans donn\u00e9es. Les donn\u00e9es jouent un r\u00f4le central dans tous les processus d'apprentissage automatique, car elles sont utilis\u00e9es \u00e0 la fois pour l'apprentissage et pour les tests. Elles se pr\u00e9sentent \u00e9galement sous la forme de param\u00e8tres utilis\u00e9s pour g\u00e9rer les processus d'apprentissage. Enfin, le syst\u00e8me d'IA est une combinaison d'une certaine architecture logicielle avec tous les param\u00e8tres de l'apprentissage, ce que l'on appelle le mod\u00e8le, qui est \u00e9galement une donn\u00e9e. Il est essentiel de comprendre le r\u00f4le des donn\u00e9es dans les syst\u00e8mes d'IA ainsi que la mani\u00e8re dont elles sont s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9es, document\u00e9es et diffus\u00e9es pour pouvoir \u00e9valuer le comportement d'un syst\u00e8me d'IA. C'est important en termes de reproductibilit\u00e9 ou pour comparer deux syst\u00e8mes d'IA diff\u00e9rents. Dans le monde du traitement du langage naturel par exemple, la disponibilit\u00e9 de grandes quantit\u00e9s de donn\u00e9es orales et \u00e9crites est centrale pour la performance des correcteurs orthographiques, la pr\u00e9diction dans les moteurs de recherche, ou bien s\u00fbr la traduction automatique. Ces donn\u00e9es sont utilis\u00e9es pour construire ce que l'on appelle des mod\u00e8les de langage, qui alimentent d'autres processus avec des repr\u00e9sentations statistiques de combinaisons de mots ou de phrases. La durabilit\u00e9 des syst\u00e8mes d'intelligence artificielle d\u00e9pend donc \u00e9troitement des m\u00e9thodes de gestion des donn\u00e9es utilis\u00e9es lors de leur conception. Donn\u00e9es pour les syst\u00e8mes d'IA supervis\u00e9s et non supervis\u00e9s \u00b6 Comme nous l'avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, les syst\u00e8mes d'IA sont de deux types, selon la fa\u00e7on dont les donn\u00e9es sont utilis\u00e9es pour l'apprentissage. Les syst\u00e8mes supervis\u00e9s reposent sur la fourniture d'entr\u00e9es et des sorties correspondantes. L'apprentissage consiste donc \u00e0 apprendre au syst\u00e8me \u00e0 g\u00e9n\u00e9rer la sortie la plus probable \u00e0 partir d'entr\u00e9es inconnues. Il existe plusieurs fa\u00e7ons d'obtenir de telles donn\u00e9es. Par exemple, une base de donn\u00e9es d'images o\u00f9 chaque image est associ\u00e9e \u00e0 des mots-cl\u00e9s ou une collection de documents num\u00e9ris\u00e9s qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 transcrits par des annotateurs (cf. figure ci-dessous). Figure : Transcription automatique d'une lettre de Paul D'Estournelles (avec l'aimable autorisation de F. Chiffoleau, Coll. Archives de la Sarthe). Les syst\u00e8mes d'IA bas\u00e9s sur l'apprentissage non supervis\u00e9 ne seront pas con\u00e7us pour un comportement sp\u00e9cifique mais con\u00e7us pour supporter la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 statistique des donn\u00e9es d'apprentissage. C'est le cas par exemple des mod\u00e8les de langage tels que BERT qui tendent \u00e0 associer des positions similaires dans un espace math\u00e9matique \u00e0 des mots ayant le m\u00eame comportement syntaxique ou s\u00e9mantique, observ\u00e9 \u00e0 partir de la fourniture d'un grand nombre de phrases \u00e9chantillons pour chaque mot. De tels mod\u00e8les sont par exemple tr\u00e8s efficaces pour pr\u00e9dire les synonymes ou les mots suivants d'une s\u00e9quence donn\u00e9e. Sources - s\u00e9lection, documentation, pr\u00e9paration, annotation \u00b6 La conception d'un syst\u00e8me d'IA repose essentiellement sur la conception ad\u00e9quate de l'ensemble de donn\u00e9es qui est utilis\u00e9 pour l'entra\u00eener. Parmi les diff\u00e9rents facteurs qui entrent en jeu, on peut citer la pertinence des donn\u00e9es pour la t\u00e2che \u00e0 accomplir, la taille des donn\u00e9es qui doit correspondre \u00e0 la complexit\u00e9 de l'architecture du logiciel d'IA --- plus il y a de param\u00e8tres math\u00e9matiques \u00e0 entra\u00eener, plus il faut de donn\u00e9es --- et la vari\u00e9t\u00e9 des \u00e9chantillons qui doit refl\u00e9ter la complexit\u00e9 de la t\u00e2che. Selon les sources de donn\u00e9es, les donn\u00e9es doivent \u00eatre s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9es et souvent nettoy\u00e9es avant d'\u00eatre introduites dans le processus d'apprentissage. Si l'on prend l'exemple de l'apprentissage d'un mod\u00e8le de langage sur la base d'un contenu Web, les diff\u00e9rents \u00e9chantillons doivent \u00eatre tri\u00e9s en fonction de la langue r\u00e9elle, d\u00e9barrass\u00e9s du code Web qui les accompagne (HTML, Javascript, etc.) et \u00e9ventuellement m\u00e9lang\u00e9s pour \u00e9viter toute violation des droits d'auteur. Un bon exemple d'une telle pr\u00e9paration des donn\u00e9es est la conception du corpus OSCAR 1 . La conception de donn\u00e9es annot\u00e9es pour les syst\u00e8mes d'IA supervis\u00e9e est plus complexe car elle implique la conception d'un sch\u00e9ma d'annotation, l'organisation de campagnes d'annotation et le contr\u00f4le de la qualit\u00e9 des donn\u00e9es annot\u00e9es, par exemple en \u00e9valuant l'accord entre les annotateurs sur les m\u00eames donn\u00e9es. Dans l'ensemble, il est essentiel que le processus de conception soit bien document\u00e9 pour pouvoir remonter \u00e0 la source d'\u00e9ventuels comportements d\u00e9fectueux dans le syst\u00e8me entra\u00een\u00e9 qui en r\u00e9sulte. Syst\u00e8mes d'IA biais\u00e9s \u00b6 Comme nous venons de le mentionner, le comportement d'un syst\u00e8me d'IA d\u00e9pend \u00e9troitement de la nature des donn\u00e9es qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9es pour l'entrainer. Cela peut g\u00e9n\u00e9rer des biais possibles qui r\u00e9sultent de la s\u00e9lection des ensembles de donn\u00e9es. Par exemple, un mod\u00e8le de langage form\u00e9 uniquement \u00e0 partir d'articles de journaux couvrira des types d'expressions et de sujets compl\u00e8tement diff\u00e9rents de ceux pour lesquels on aurait choisi la litt\u00e9rature ou le contenu des r\u00e9seaux sociaux. De la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re, les syst\u00e8mes de g\u00e9n\u00e9ration d'images refl\u00e9teront la taille et la vari\u00e9t\u00e9 des bases de donn\u00e9es d'images sources (par exemple, des \u0153uvres artistiques) qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9es. Dans le cas des syst\u00e8mes supervis\u00e9s, un biais sp\u00e9cifique peut provenir de la mani\u00e8re dont les \u00e9tiquettes d'annotation sont con\u00e7ues ainsi que de la mani\u00e8re dont les annotateurs, avec leur propre bagage culturel, interpr\u00e9teront les donn\u00e9es. Si, par exemple, vous voulez identifier les discours de haine sur les r\u00e9seaux sociaux, la fa\u00e7on dont les sentiments sont interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s par les annotateurs peut varier en fonction de l'\u00e2ge, de la culture et des sentiments personnels des annotateurs vis-\u00e0-vis du mat\u00e9riel \u00e0 annoter. Dans l'ensemble, il faut toujours garder \u00e0 l'esprit que les syst\u00e8mes d'IA sont, par construction, tr\u00e8s conservateurs en ce qui concerne leurs donn\u00e9es d'entra\u00eenement et donc les observables existants. On ne peut pas s'attendre \u00e0 une r\u00e9elle cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9 de la part d'un syst\u00e8me d'IA. H\u00e9bergement, mise en commun, distribution des donn\u00e9es \u00b6 En raison de la taille et de la complexit\u00e9 possible des donn\u00e9es d'entra\u00eenement des syst\u00e8mes d'IA ainsi que des mod\u00e8les qui en r\u00e9sultent, diverses initiatives ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mises en place pour permettre leur h\u00e9bergement et leur distribution. Les ensembles de donn\u00e9es et les mod\u00e8les ouverts peuvent \u00eatre h\u00e9berg\u00e9s dans des d\u00e9p\u00f4ts sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9s (par exemple, la ressource de donn\u00e9es d'image 2 ) ou dans des d\u00e9p\u00f4ts g\u00e9n\u00e9riques nationaux ou internationaux (par exemple, Zenodo 3 ). Ces d\u00e9p\u00f4ts fournissent g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement l'infrastructure n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la gestion des auteurs, des licences, des versions et de l'archivage de leur contenu. Dans le cas de t\u00e2ches complexes, o\u00f9 plusieurs \u00e9quipes travaillent en parall\u00e8le sur l'annotation d'une vari\u00e9t\u00e9 d'\u00e9chantillons de donn\u00e9es, certaines initiatives font office de catalogues pour les sources de donn\u00e9es correspondantes. C'est le cas par exemple de l'initiative HTR United 4 qui rassemble les m\u00e9tadonn\u00e9es des documents annot\u00e9s pour la reconnaissance de textes (manuscrits).

Une application de ce type de probl\u00e8me est, par exemple, un algorithme de classification de photos. Dans l'exemple ci-dessous, il y a une entr\u00e9e (caract\u00e9ristique) qui s\u00e9pare les points horizontalement et une autre qui les s\u00e9pare verticalement. En combinant ces deux entr\u00e9es, on obtient une s\u00e9paration oblique. Le r\u00e9sultat (sortie) est bien adapt\u00e9 au type de donn\u00e9es choisi. Vue de l'interface de TensorFlow TensorFlow : Quelques explications avant d'essayer la simulation d'un r\u00e9seau de neurones \u00b6 Source : Site web Pixees Qu'est-ce qu'un r\u00e9seau de neurones et comment fonctionne-t-il? Un r\u00e9seau de neurones est un m\u00e9canisme g\u00e9n\u00e9rique compos\u00e9 de petites unit\u00e9s (pseudo-neurones) connect\u00e9es les unes aux autres. Chaque unit\u00e9 effectue une op\u00e9ration tr\u00e8s simple : elle prend des valeurs en entr\u00e9e, les combine tr\u00e8s simplement (une simple moyenne avec des coefficients) et applique une transformation sur le r\u00e9sultat (par exemple, ne garder que les valeurs positives). Les coefficients utilis\u00e9s pour pond\u00e9rer la moyenne sont les param\u00e8tres de cet algorithme. C'est la combinaison d'un tr\u00e8s, tr\u00e8s grand nombre de ces unit\u00e9s qui permet de r\u00e9aliser des op\u00e9rations tr\u00e8s complexes. Un r\u00e9seau de tels \"neurones\" est obtenu en accumulant plusieurs couches de ces unit\u00e9s. L'entr\u00e9e est constitu\u00e9e des donn\u00e9es que l'on veut traiter. Elles sont transform\u00e9es \u00e0 travers toutes les couches et la derni\u00e8re couche donne en sortie une pr\u00e9diction sur ces donn\u00e9es, par exemple pour d\u00e9tecter s'il y a un visage dans une image. Le r\u00e9seau de neurones est donc une fonction param\u00e9tr\u00e9e avec de nombreux coefficients (appel\u00e9s \"poids\") et c'est le choix de ces poids qui d\u00e9finit le traitement effectu\u00e9. O\u00f9 sont les neurones dans TensorFlow ? Sur l'interface web de TensorFlow, on peut facilement cr\u00e9er un r\u00e9seau d'une dizaine de neurones, chacun ayant entre 3 et 10 param\u00e8tres. La sortie calcul\u00e9e d\u00e9pend donc de centaines de param\u00e8tres en plus des deux coordonn\u00e9es (x,y) du point d'entr\u00e9e. Sur l'interface, chaque carr\u00e9 repr\u00e9sente un neurone et la couleur du pixel de coordonn\u00e9es (x,y) dans le carr\u00e9 repr\u00e9sente la sortie du neurone lorsqu'on met (x,y) en entr\u00e9e du r\u00e9seau. S'il n'y a qu'un seul neurone en sortie, il est repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par un carr\u00e9 plus grand \u00e0 droite du r\u00e9seau. Les param\u00e8tres du r\u00e9seau sont initialis\u00e9s avec des valeurs al\u00e9atoires. Mais comment apprendre ces poids ? L'apprentissage supervis\u00e9 consiste \u00e0 fournir des exemples de donn\u00e9es avec la solution \u00e0 trouver afin d'entra\u00eener le r\u00e9seau \u00e0 ajuster ces poids selon les besoins. Dans l'exemple de la figure ci-dessus, il s'agit d'une s\u00e9rie de points dans un carr\u00e9, chacun avec une couleur attendue (bleu ou orange), dans le but de pr\u00e9dire la couleur du point \u00e0 un endroit donn\u00e9. Un algorithme classique d'ajustement progressif des poids est utilis\u00e9 pour trouver les param\u00e8tres en question. Le bouton \"play\" en haut \u00e0 gauche de l'interface permet de lancer cet algorithme, et l'on voit alors la sortie du r\u00e9seau de neurones \u00e9voluer au cours du processus \"d'apprentissage\" : la couleur de fond du neurone de sortie tend \u00e0 prendre la couleur des points d'entra\u00eenement qui sont dessin\u00e9s sur lui. Une autre partie de l'ensemble de donn\u00e9es est ensuite utilis\u00e9e pour tester la qualit\u00e9 de la fonction r\u00e9sultante du r\u00e9seau. Une courbe en haut \u00e0 droite montre le taux d'erreur des donn\u00e9es utilis\u00e9es pour l'apprentissage (pour v\u00e9rifier que les poids ont \u00e9t\u00e9 correctement ajust\u00e9s) et le taux d'erreur des autres donn\u00e9es de test (pour v\u00e9rifier que ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 appris se g\u00e9n\u00e9ralise bien \u00e0 de nouvelles donn\u00e9es). Les boutons sur le c\u00f4t\u00e9 gauche permettent d'ajuster la distribution des donn\u00e9es entre l'ensemble d'apprentissage et l'ensemble de test et aussi d'ajouter des erreurs aux donn\u00e9es (donn\u00e9es bruit\u00e9es) pour voir si le m\u00e9canisme est robuste \u00e0 ces erreurs. En pratique, on arrive \u00e0 trouver des param\u00e8tres satisfaisants, mais il n'y a pas vraiment de cadre th\u00e9orique pour formaliser tout cela, c'est une question d'exp\u00e9rimentation : choisir le bon nombre de neurones, le bon nombre de couches de neurones, quels calculs pr\u00e9liminaires ajouter en entr\u00e9e (par exemple multiplier les entr\u00e9es pour augmenter les degr\u00e9s de libert\u00e9 du calcul). Ce type de techniques peut donner des r\u00e9sultats impressionnants dans la pratique, comme dans la reconnaissance de la voix ou des objets dans une image. Toutefois, comprendre pourquoi (et comment) on obtient de si bons r\u00e9sultats reste une question scientifique assez ouverte.

Un r\u00e9seau de neurones est un m\u00e9canisme g\u00e9n\u00e9rique compos\u00e9 de petites unit\u00e9s (pseudo-neurones) connect\u00e9es les unes aux autres. Chaque unit\u00e9 effectue une op\u00e9ration tr\u00e8s simple : elle prend des valeurs en entr\u00e9e, les combine tr\u00e8s simplement (une simple moyenne avec des coefficients) et applique une transformation sur le r\u00e9sultat (par exemple, ne garder que les valeurs positives). Les coefficients utilis\u00e9s pour pond\u00e9rer la moyenne sont les param\u00e8tres de cet algorithme. C'est la combinaison d'un tr\u00e8s, tr\u00e8s grand nombre de ces unit\u00e9s qui permet de r\u00e9aliser des op\u00e9rations tr\u00e8s complexes. Un r\u00e9seau de tels \"neurones\" est obtenu en accumulant plusieurs couches de ces unit\u00e9s. L'entr\u00e9e est constitu\u00e9e des donn\u00e9es que l'on veut traiter. Elles sont transform\u00e9es \u00e0 travers toutes les couches et la derni\u00e8re couche donne en sortie une pr\u00e9diction sur ces donn\u00e9es, par exemple pour d\u00e9tecter s'il y a un visage dans une image. Le r\u00e9seau de neurones est donc une fonction param\u00e9tr\u00e9e avec de nombreux coefficients (appel\u00e9s \"poids\") et c'est le choix de ces poids qui d\u00e9finit le traitement effectu\u00e9. O\u00f9 sont les neurones dans TensorFlow ? Sur l'interface web de TensorFlow, on peut facilement cr\u00e9er un r\u00e9seau d'une dizaine de neurones, chacun ayant entre 3 et 10 param\u00e8tres. La sortie calcul\u00e9e d\u00e9pend donc de centaines de param\u00e8tres en plus des deux coordonn\u00e9es (x,y) du point d'entr\u00e9e. Sur l'interface, chaque carr\u00e9 repr\u00e9sente un neurone et la couleur du pixel de coordonn\u00e9es (x,y) dans le carr\u00e9 repr\u00e9sente la sortie du neurone lorsqu'on met (x,y) en entr\u00e9e du r\u00e9seau. S'il n'y a qu'un seul neurone en sortie, il est repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par un carr\u00e9 plus grand \u00e0 droite du r\u00e9seau. Les param\u00e8tres du r\u00e9seau sont initialis\u00e9s avec des valeurs al\u00e9atoires. Mais comment apprendre ces poids ? L'apprentissage supervis\u00e9 consiste \u00e0 fournir des exemples de donn\u00e9es avec la solution \u00e0 trouver afin d'entra\u00eener le r\u00e9seau \u00e0 ajuster ces poids selon les besoins. Dans l'exemple de la figure ci-dessus, il s'agit d'une s\u00e9rie de points dans un carr\u00e9, chacun avec une couleur attendue (bleu ou orange), dans le but de pr\u00e9dire la couleur du point \u00e0 un endroit donn\u00e9. Un algorithme classique d'ajustement progressif des poids est utilis\u00e9 pour trouver les param\u00e8tres en question. Le bouton \"play\" en haut \u00e0 gauche de l'interface permet de lancer cet algorithme, et l'on voit alors la sortie du r\u00e9seau de neurones \u00e9voluer au cours du processus \"d'apprentissage\" : la couleur de fond du neurone de sortie tend \u00e0 prendre la couleur des points d'entra\u00eenement qui sont dessin\u00e9s sur lui. Une autre partie de l'ensemble de donn\u00e9es est ensuite utilis\u00e9e pour tester la qualit\u00e9 de la fonction r\u00e9sultante du r\u00e9seau. Une courbe en haut \u00e0 droite montre le taux d'erreur des donn\u00e9es utilis\u00e9es pour l'apprentissage (pour v\u00e9rifier que les poids ont \u00e9t\u00e9 correctement ajust\u00e9s) et le taux d'erreur des autres donn\u00e9es de test (pour v\u00e9rifier que ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 appris se g\u00e9n\u00e9ralise bien \u00e0 de nouvelles donn\u00e9es). Les boutons sur le c\u00f4t\u00e9 gauche permettent d'ajuster la distribution des donn\u00e9es entre l'ensemble d'apprentissage et l'ensemble de test et aussi d'ajouter des erreurs aux donn\u00e9es (donn\u00e9es bruit\u00e9es) pour voir si le m\u00e9canisme est robuste \u00e0 ces erreurs. En pratique, on arrive \u00e0 trouver des param\u00e8tres satisfaisants, mais il n'y a pas vraiment de cadre th\u00e9orique pour formaliser tout cela, c'est une question d'exp\u00e9rimentation : choisir le bon nombre de neurones, le bon nombre de couches de neurones, quels calculs pr\u00e9liminaires ajouter en entr\u00e9e (par exemple multiplier les entr\u00e9es pour augmenter les degr\u00e9s de libert\u00e9 du calcul). Ce type de techniques peut donner des r\u00e9sultats impressionnants dans la pratique, comme dans la reconnaissance de la voix ou des objets dans une image. Toutefois, comprendre pourquoi (et comment) on obtient de si bons r\u00e9sultats reste une question scientifique assez ouverte.","title":"TensorFlow : Quelques explications avant d'essayer la simulation d'un r\u00e9seau de neurones"},{"location":"fr/1-Mooc/module-3-how-does-AI-work/3-2-lets-play-with-the-data/3-2-5a-play-with-the-machine-neurons.html#essayez-tensorflow","text":"Cliquez sur l'image ci-dessous pour acc\u00e9der \u00e0 l'application TensorFlow dans une nouvelle fen\u00eatre .

Il peut donc s'av\u00e9rer difficile de d\u00e9terminer si une personne a \u00e9t\u00e9 injustement d\u00e9savantag\u00e9e, par exemple lors d'une d\u00e9cision d'embauche ou d'une demande de prestations publiques \" . Quatre niveaux de risque ont \u00e9t\u00e9 identifi\u00e9s, de inacceptable \u00e0 minimal : Risque inacceptable : Tous les syst\u00e8mes d'IA consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme une menace claire pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9, les moyens de subsistance et les droits des personnes seront interdits, du marquage social par les gouvernements aux jouets utilisant une assistance vocale qui encourage les comportements dangereux. Risque \u00e9lev\u00e9 : Les syst\u00e8mes d'IA identifi\u00e9s comme \u00e9tant \u00e0 haut risque comprennent les technologies d'IA utilis\u00e9es dans : Les infrastructures critiques (par exemple, les transports), qui pourraient mettre en danger la vie et la sant\u00e9 des citoyens ; La formation \u00e9ducative ou professionnelle, qui peut d\u00e9terminer l'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l'\u00e9ducation et le parcours professionnel d'une personne (par exemple, la notation des examens) ; Les composants de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des produits (par exemple, l'application de l'IA dans la chirurgie assist\u00e9e par robot) ; L'emploi, la gestion des travailleurs et l'acc\u00e8s au travail ind\u00e9pendant (par exemple, un logiciel de tri des CV pour les proc\u00e9dures de recrutement) ; Les services priv\u00e9s et publics essentiels (par exemple, l'\u00e9valuation du cr\u00e9dit qui prive les citoyens de la possibilit\u00e9 d'obtenir un pr\u00eat) ; L'application de la loi qui peut interf\u00e9rer avec les droits fondamentaux des personnes (par exemple, l'\u00e9valuation de la fiabilit\u00e9 des preuves) ; La gestion des migrations, de l'asile et des contr\u00f4les aux fronti\u00e8res (par exemple, la v\u00e9rification de l'authenticit\u00e9 des documents de voyage) ; L'administration de la justice et les processus d\u00e9mocratiques (par exemple, l'application de la loi \u00e0 un ensemble concret de faits). Risque limit\u00e9 : Le risque limit\u00e9 fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux syst\u00e8mes d'IA ayant des obligations de transparence sp\u00e9cifiques. Lors de l'utilisation de syst\u00e8mes d'IA tels que les chatbots, les utilisateurs doivent \u00eatre conscients qu'ils interagissent avec une machine afin de pouvoir prendre une d\u00e9cision \u00e9clair\u00e9e de poursuivre ou de prendre du recul. Risque minimal ou nul : La proposition permet la libre utilisation de l'IA \u00e0 risque minimal. Cela inclut des applications telles que les jeux vid\u00e9o ou les filtres anti-spam utilisant l'IA. La grande majorit\u00e9 des syst\u00e8mes d'IA actuellement utilis\u00e9s dans l'UE entrent dans cette cat\u00e9gorie. Les 4 niveaux risques li\u00e9s \u00e0 l'intelligence artificielle expos\u00e9s dans la l\u00e9gislation sur l'IA de la Commission europ\u00e9enne. Le classement de l'enseignement et de la formation professionnelle dans la cat\u00e9gorie \u00e0 haut risque ne signifie pas qu'aucun syst\u00e8me d'IA ne doit \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 dans ces domaines, mais que des pr\u00e9cautions suppl\u00e9mentaires doivent \u00eatre prises.

Il peut donc s'av\u00e9rer difficile de d\u00e9terminer si une personne a \u00e9t\u00e9 injustement d\u00e9savantag\u00e9e, par exemple lors d'une d\u00e9cision d'embauche ou d'une demande de prestations publiques \" . Quatre niveaux de risque ont \u00e9t\u00e9 identifi\u00e9s, de inacceptable \u00e0 minimal : Risque inacceptable : Tous les syst\u00e8mes d'IA consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme une menace claire pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9, les moyens de subsistance et les droits des personnes seront interdits, du marquage social par les gouvernements aux jouets utilisant une assistance vocale qui encourage les comportements dangereux. Risque \u00e9lev\u00e9 : Les syst\u00e8mes d'IA identifi\u00e9s comme \u00e9tant \u00e0 haut risque comprennent les technologies d'IA utilis\u00e9es dans : Les infrastructures critiques (par exemple, les transports), qui pourraient mettre en danger la vie et la sant\u00e9 des citoyens ; La formation \u00e9ducative ou professionnelle, qui peut d\u00e9terminer l'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l'\u00e9ducation et le parcours professionnel d'une personne (par exemple, la notation des examens) ; Les composants de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des produits (par exemple, l'application de l'IA dans la chirurgie assist\u00e9e par robot) ; L'emploi, la gestion des travailleurs et l'acc\u00e8s au travail ind\u00e9pendant (par exemple, un logiciel de tri des CV pour les proc\u00e9dures de recrutement) ; Les services priv\u00e9s et publics essentiels (par exemple, l'\u00e9valuation du cr\u00e9dit qui prive les citoyens de la possibilit\u00e9 d'obtenir un pr\u00eat) ; L'application de la loi qui peut interf\u00e9rer avec les droits fondamentaux des personnes (par exemple, l'\u00e9valuation de la fiabilit\u00e9 des preuves) ; La gestion des migrations, de l'asile et des contr\u00f4les aux fronti\u00e8res (par exemple, la v\u00e9rification de l'authenticit\u00e9 des documents de voyage) ; L'administration de la justice et les processus d\u00e9mocratiques (par exemple, l'application de la loi \u00e0 un ensemble concret de faits). Risque limit\u00e9 : Le risque limit\u00e9 fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux syst\u00e8mes d'IA ayant des obligations de transparence sp\u00e9cifiques. Lors de l'utilisation de syst\u00e8mes d'IA tels que les chatbots, les utilisateurs doivent \u00eatre conscients qu'ils interagissent avec une machine afin de pouvoir prendre une d\u00e9cision \u00e9clair\u00e9e de poursuivre ou de prendre du recul. Risque minimal ou nul : La proposition permet la libre utilisation de l'IA \u00e0 risque minimal. Cela inclut des applications telles que les jeux vid\u00e9o ou les filtres anti-spam utilisant l'IA. La grande majorit\u00e9 des syst\u00e8mes d'IA actuellement utilis\u00e9s dans l'UE entrent dans cette cat\u00e9gorie. Les 4 niveaux risques li\u00e9s \u00e0 l'intelligence artificielle expos\u00e9s dans la l\u00e9gislation sur l'IA de la Commission europ\u00e9enne. Le classement de l'enseignement et de la formation professionnelle dans la cat\u00e9gorie \u00e0 haut risque ne signifie pas qu'aucun syst\u00e8me d'IA ne doit \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 dans ces domaines, mais que des pr\u00e9cautions suppl\u00e9mentaires doivent \u00eatre prises.

Compte tenu de l'importance des d\u00e9cisions prises dans ces domaines, ce sont des exemples int\u00e9ressants \u00e0 \u00e9tudier. IA et m\u00e9decine \u00b6 \" L\u2019IA est en effet au c\u0153ur de la m\u00e9decine du futur avec les op\u00e9rations assist\u00e9es, le suivi des patients \u00e0 distance, les proth\u00e8ses intelligentes, ou encore les traitements personnalis\u00e9s gr\u00e2ce au recoupement de donn\u00e9es (big data) .\" 1 Il y a une cinquantaine d'ann\u00e9es, c'est dans le domaine du diagnostic qu'a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 l'un des syst\u00e8mes experts les plus connus : MYCIN. \" C'\u00e9tait un des premiers syst\u00e8mes experts qui utilisait l'intelligence artificielle pour identifier les bact\u00e9ries responsables d'infections graves, telles que la bact\u00e9ri\u00e9mie et la m\u00e9ningite, et pour recommander des antibiotiques, dont la dose \u00e9tait ajust\u00e9e en fonction du poids corporel du patient \" 2 . D\u00e9velopp\u00e9 \u00e0 partir de 1972, MYCIN a \u00e9t\u00e9 capable, 6 ans plus tard, de surpasser les m\u00e9decins dans l'\u00e9tablissement de diagnostics pr\u00e9cis. Dans un test grandeur nature, il est demand\u00e9 \u00e0 MYCIN et \u00e0 9 m\u00e9decins, internes et universitaires, de r\u00e9aliser des diagnostics et d'ex\u00e9cuter des prescriptions sur 80 patients atteints de m\u00e9ningite. Les diagnostics et les prescriptions ont ensuite \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9s en aveugle par 8 sp\u00e9cialistes de la m\u00e9ningite et .... MYCIN a obtenu un meilleur score que les experts humains. Aujourd'hui, un domaine important de l'utilisation de l'apprentissage automatique \u00e0 des fins m\u00e9dicales est l'analyse d'images pour les diagnostics m\u00e9dicaux 3 . En quelques mots, voyons comment cela fonctionne, comme l'explique Ga\u00ebl Varoquaux, chercheur Inria en IA : \" Le machine learning est l'une des branches de l'intelligence artificielle (IA). On le traduit en fran\u00e7ais par apprentissage automatique. En r\u00e9sumant \u00e0 l'extr\u00eame, la technique consiste \u00e0 nourrir le logiciel de milliers d'exemples pour qu'il apprenne \u00e0 effectuer des t\u00e2ches de classement. Par exemple, dans des images, savoir trouver des chiens ou des chats. Des grains de beaut\u00e9 ou des m\u00e9lanomes malins. En th\u00e9orie, cela ouvre un boulevard d'applications pour la m\u00e9decine. On collecte par exemple les radiographies de milliers de patients souffrant de la m\u00eame maladie dans ce qu'on appelle une cohorte. Puis, gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 ces donn\u00e9es d'apprentissage, l'ordinateur va ensuite d\u00e9tecter les m\u00eames caract\u00e9ristiques visuelles dans de nouvelles images prises lors de d\u00e9pistage chez d'autres personnes. Ce sont alors les donn\u00e9es cibles .\" 4 IA et justice \u00b6 Dans le domaine de la justice, deux utilisations principales des syst\u00e8mes d'IA sont identifi\u00e9es. Il s'agit tout d'abord des outils d'aide \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision. Un syst\u00e8me d'IA peut aider un juge dans l'instruction d'une affaire, par exemple en l'informant de tous les jugements rendus par les tribunaux comp\u00e9tents dans des affaires similaires. Dans ce cas, l'IA am\u00e9liore la recherche d'informations mais la d\u00e9cision est prise par le juge seul 5 . Il existe ensuite des outils capables de pr\u00e9dire les d\u00e9cisions. Dans ce cas, l'IA propose directement au juge une d\u00e9cision de justice 6 . Le logiciel analyse un grand nombre d'exemples de d\u00e9cisions de justice et en d\u00e9duit \"automatiquement\" des r\u00e8gles de d\u00e9cision. L'\u00e9mergence de la justice pr\u00e9dictive suscite de nombreuses inqui\u00e9tudes. Si \" l'application de l'IA dans le domaine de la justice peut contribuer \u00e0 en am\u00e9liorer l'efficacit\u00e9 et la qualit\u00e9 \" [elle] \" doit \u00eatre mise en \u0153uvre d'une mani\u00e8re responsable et conforme aux droits fondamentaux \" 7 . Au niveau europ\u00e9en, une Charte \u00e9thique sur l'utilisation de l'intelligence artificielle dans les syst\u00e8mes judiciaires et leur environnement a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e en 2018. Organis\u00e9e autour de 5 principes, elle reconna\u00eet l'importance de la non-discrimination, du respect des droits fondamentaux, de la qualit\u00e9, de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9, de la transparence, de l'impartialit\u00e9 et de l'\u00e9quit\u00e9. Elle souligne enfin le principe \"sous le contr\u00f4le de l'utilisateur\" : \" en excluant une approche prescriptive et en veillant \u00e0 ce que les utilisateurs soient des acteurs inform\u00e9s et ma\u00eetres de leurs choix \" 7 . En droit comme en \u00e9ducation ou en m\u00e9decine, l'aide \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision fournie par le syst\u00e8me d'IA peut am\u00e9liorer la d\u00e9cision prise. Au regard des cons\u00e9quences potentielles de ces m\u00eames d\u00e9cisions, le maintien d'un contr\u00f4le humain est un enjeu important pour le d\u00e9veloppement des syst\u00e8mes d'IA dans les ann\u00e9es \u00e0 venir. Tout utilisateur de ceux-ci doit \u00eatre capable de garder un usage critique de la proposition de d\u00e9cision faite par les syst\u00e8mes d'IA. Par exemple, dans la d\u00e9tection de certains cancers, les syst\u00e8mes sont si bien entra\u00een\u00e9s sur certaines caract\u00e9ristiques visuelles qu'ils font d'excellents diagnostics sur ces manifestations mais ne sont plus capables de reconna\u00eetre les autres.

Par exemple, dans des images, savoir trouver des chiens ou des chats. Des grains de beaut\u00e9 ou des m\u00e9lanomes malins. En th\u00e9orie, cela ouvre un boulevard d'applications pour la m\u00e9decine. On collecte par exemple les radiographies de milliers de patients souffrant de la m\u00eame maladie dans ce qu'on appelle une cohorte.

Il s'agit tout d'abord des outils d'aide \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision. Un syst\u00e8me d'IA peut aider un juge dans l'instruction d'une affaire, par exemple en l'informant de tous les jugements rendus par les tribunaux comp\u00e9tents dans des affaires similaires. Dans ce cas, l'IA am\u00e9liore la recherche d'informations mais la d\u00e9cision est prise par le juge seul 5 . Il existe ensuite des outils capables de pr\u00e9dire les d\u00e9cisions. Dans ce cas, l'IA propose directement au juge une d\u00e9cision de justice 6 . Le logiciel analyse un grand nombre d'exemples de d\u00e9cisions de justice et en d\u00e9duit \"automatiquement\" des r\u00e8gles de d\u00e9cision. L'\u00e9mergence de la justice pr\u00e9dictive suscite de nombreuses inqui\u00e9tudes. Si \" l'application de l'IA dans le domaine de la justice peut contribuer \u00e0 en am\u00e9liorer l'efficacit\u00e9 et la qualit\u00e9 \" [elle] \" doit \u00eatre mise en \u0153uvre d'une mani\u00e8re responsable et conforme aux droits fondamentaux \" 7 . Au niveau europ\u00e9en, une Charte \u00e9thique sur l'utilisation de l'intelligence artificielle dans les syst\u00e8mes judiciaires et leur environnement a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e en 2018. Organis\u00e9e autour de 5 principes, elle reconna\u00eet l'importance de la non-discrimination, du respect des droits fondamentaux, de la qualit\u00e9, de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9, de la transparence, de l'impartialit\u00e9 et de l'\u00e9quit\u00e9. Elle souligne enfin le principe \"sous le contr\u00f4le de l'utilisateur\" : \" en excluant une approche prescriptive et en veillant \u00e0 ce que les utilisateurs soient des acteurs inform\u00e9s et ma\u00eetres de leurs choix \" 7 . En droit comme en \u00e9ducation ou en m\u00e9decine, l'aide \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision fournie par le syst\u00e8me d'IA peut am\u00e9liorer la d\u00e9cision prise. Au regard des cons\u00e9quences potentielles de ces m\u00eames d\u00e9cisions, le maintien d'un contr\u00f4le humain est un enjeu important pour le d\u00e9veloppement des syst\u00e8mes d'IA dans les ann\u00e9es \u00e0 venir. Tout utilisateur de ceux-ci doit \u00eatre capable de garder un usage critique de la proposition de d\u00e9cision faite par les syst\u00e8mes d'IA. Par exemple, dans la d\u00e9tection de certains cancers, les syst\u00e8mes sont si bien entra\u00een\u00e9s sur certaines caract\u00e9ristiques visuelles qu'ils font d'excellents diagnostics sur ces manifestations mais ne sont plus capables de reconna\u00eetre les autres.

Explicabilit\u00e9 \u00b6 Explicabilit\u00e9 - l'une des 7 conditions requises pour une IA digne de confiance : \" L'explicabilit\u00e9 concerne la capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 expliquer \u00e0 la fois les processus techniques d'un syst\u00e8me d'IA et les d\u00e9cisions humaines correspondantes (par exemple, les domaines d'application d'un syst\u00e8me).

Elle contraste avec le concept de \"bo\u00eete noire\" de l'apprentissage automatique, o\u00f9 m\u00eame les concepteurs ne peuvent expliquer pourquoi l'IA est parvenue \u00e0 une d\u00e9cision sp\u00e9cifique \" [Traduction Deepl] 2 .

Une pr\u00e9diction faite \u00e0 partir d'un arbre de d\u00e9cision, par exemple, est explicable.

Sources et r\u00e9f\u00e9rences bibliographiques Un travail important est \u00e0 faire pour compl\u00e9ter ou remplacer les ressources en anglais mentionn\u00e9es dans le Mooc. Voici deux solutions que nous avons adopt\u00e9es dans le cadre du projet. Lorsqu'aucune substitution n'est possible : maintien de la ressource originale en anglais (comme par exemple, des documents tels que l'AI Watch, les publications du JRC, etc.) Lorsqu'une ressource alternative existe, elle peut \u00eatre list\u00e9e \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la ressource originale. Afin d'\u00eatre le plus proche possible du contexte local, l'ajout de r\u00e9f\u00e9rences dans les langues cibles est recommand\u00e9. Rappel sur la qualit\u00e9/pr\u00e9cision de la traduction Les textes traduits sont g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9s par DeepL \u00e0 partir d'une version du Mooc (nous recommandons d'utiliser la version anglaise comme base pour les traductions ult\u00e9rieures). Des ajustements pour am\u00e9liorer la qualit\u00e9 de la traduction peuvent \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaires et une premi\u00e8re relecture doit \u00eatre effectu\u00e9e ; parfois DeepL interpr\u00e8te des signes (tels que \"*\") de mani\u00e8re incorrecte et il peut y avoir des divergences dans la traduction (un ou plusieurs \u00e9l\u00e9ments du texte sont rest\u00e9s dans la langue source).

Sources et r\u00e9f\u00e9rences bibliographiques Un travail important est \u00e0 faire pour compl\u00e9ter ou remplacer les ressources en anglais mentionn\u00e9es dans le Mooc.

Subject: Artificial Intelligence for and by Teachers Authors: AI4T Licence: CC BY 4.0 Date: 2022-11-15 Futuri dell'apprendimento da parte di esperti nel campo dell'istruzione \u00b6 L'Intelligenza Artificiale \u00e8 gi\u00e0 in classe. \u00b6 Le tecnologie di Intelligenza Artificiale (IA) hanno il potenziale per supportare nuove pratiche didattiche e professionali a vantaggio di insegnanti e alunni. Esempi di attivit\u00e0 nel settore dell'istruzione gi\u00e0 sperimentate nelle classi e supportate dalle tecnologie AI sono: Apprendimento personalizzato passo dopo passo raggruppamento dinamico degli studenti per un lavoro di classe pi\u00f9 efficace Analisi della scrittura degli studenti e valutazione automatica Chatbot di supporto agli studenti Generazione automatica di test Monitoraggio dei risultati di apprendimento degli studenti Attivit\u00e0 amministrative come la programmazione delle lezioni o la risposta a domande comuni A questi pochi esempi, si potrebbe aggiungere un lungo elenco di strumenti ormai integrati nella vita quotidiana di insegnanti e alunni quando utilizzano i servizi digitali, come la correzione ortografica automatica, le raccomandazioni e le letture suggerite, il filtro antispam delle e-mail, il riconoscimento automatico della voce o del volto, ecc. Se consideriamo solo i compiti specifici orientati all'istruzione, Fengchun & al. hanno definito una serie di quattro categorie di applicazioni emergenti e potenziali basate sui bisogni 1 : Gestione e erogazione dell'istruzione; Apprendimento e valutazione; Potenziamento degli insegnanti e miglioramento dell'insegnamento; e l'apprendimento permanente. Holmes & al. 2 hanno classificato i diversi tipi di sistemi basati sull'IA per l'istruzione come segue. Diversi tipi di sistemi attuali basati sull'IA per l'istruzione (da Holmes & al. 2019) Sfide legate all'IA e all'istruzione \u00b6 Queste tecnologie emergenti di IA devono essere messe in discussione anche nel contesto dell'uso dell'istruzione. Per sfruttare le opportunit\u00e0 e mitigare i rischi potenziali dell'IA nel campo dell'istruzione, nel rapporto UNESCO di Fengchun & al. del 2021 sono state identificate le seguenti sfide: Come si pu\u00f2 sfruttare l'IA per migliorare l'istruzione? \"Nell'ultimo decennio, l'uso di strumenti di IA per supportare o migliorare l'apprendimento \u00e8 cresciuto in modo esponenziale 3 . Questa tendenza \u00e8 aumentata solo in seguito alla chiusura delle scuole COVID-19. Tuttavia, rimangono scarse le prove su come l'IA possa migliorare i risultati dell'apprendimento e se possa aiutare gli scienziati e i professionisti dell'apprendimento a comprendere meglio come avviene un apprendimento efficace 4 . Inoltre, dobbiamo ancora esplorare il potenziale dell'IA nel monitoraggio dei risultati dell'apprendimento in diversi contesti e nella valutazione delle competenze, in particolare quelle acquisite in contesti non formali e informali \" . [deepl translation] \"L'IA ha anche il potenziale per facilitare nuovi approcci alla valutazione, come la valutazione adattiva e continua abilitata dall'IA 5 . Tuttavia, \u00e8 importante riconoscere fin da subito che l'uso dell'IA per l'apprendimento e la valutazione solleva anche diverse preoccupazioni che devono ancora essere affrontate in modo adeguato. Tra queste, le preoccupazioni relative al loro approccio alla pedagogia, la mancanza di prove solide della loro efficacia e del loro potenziale impatto sul ruolo degli insegnanti, nonch\u00e9 questioni etiche pi\u00f9 ampie 6 7 .\" [deepl translation] \" Molte applicazioni di IA rivolte agli insegnanti mirano ad aiutarli a ridurre il carico di lavoro automatizzando compiti come la valutazione, il rilevamento dei plagi, la somministrazione e il feedback. Questo, si sostiene spesso, dovrebbe liberare tempo per gli insegnanti da investire in altri compiti, come fornire un supporto pi\u00f9 efficace ai singoli studenti. \" [deepl translation] Come possiamo garantire un uso etico, inclusivo ed equo dell'IA nell'istruzione? \"L'uso etico, inclusivo ed equo dell'IA nell'istruzione ha un impatto su ciascuno degli Obiettivi di sviluppo sostenibile. Ci sono questioni incentrate sui dati e sugli algoritmi, sulle scelte pedagogiche, sull'inclusione e sul \"divario digitale\", sul diritto dei bambini alla privacy, alla libert\u00e0 e a uno sviluppo senza ostacoli, e sull'equit\u00e0 in termini di genere, disabilit\u00e0, status sociale ed economico, background etnico e culturale e posizione geografica \" . [deepl translation] Come pu\u00f2 l'istruzione preparare gli esseri umani a vivere e lavorare con l'IA? \"Se il mondo vuole garantire che l'IA non aggravi le disuguaglianze esistenti, sar\u00e0 sempre pi\u00f9 importante che ogni cittadino abbia l'opportunit\u00e0 di sviluppare una solida comprensione dell'IA: cos'\u00e8, come funziona e come potrebbe avere un impatto sulla propria vita. Questo aspetto viene talvolta definito \"alfabetizzazione all'IA\". Per questo, gli insegnanti giocheranno un ruolo fondamentale \" . [deepl translation] \" Aiutare gli studenti a imparare a vivere efficacemente in un mondo sempre pi\u00f9 influenzato dall'IA richiede una pedagogia che ponga maggiormente l'accento sulle competenze umane (ad esempio pensiero critico, comunicazione, collaborazione e creativit\u00e0) e sulla capacit\u00e0 di collaborare con gli strumenti pervasivi dell'IA nella vita, nell'apprendimento e nel lavoro \" . [deepl translation] Competenze fondamentali richieste nell'era dell'IA \u00b6 L'impiego di tecnologie basate sull'IA a scuola solleva interrogativi sull'impatto dell'uso di tali sistemi sulle competenze didattiche, come sottolineato dal Centro comune di ricerca (CCR), il servizio per la scienza e la conoscenza della Commissione europea 8 : In che misura l'insegnante o l'utente devono essere consapevoli della tecnologia sottostante? Quante conoscenze dovrebbero avere gli educatori sull'IA per poter agire in modo informato ed efficace come educatori? Le tecnologie emergenti di oggi avranno un impatto sulle competenze professionali degli insegnanti in futuro? Gli autori del rapporto del Joint Research Center sottolineano che, oltre alle conoscenze pedagogiche generali, alle conoscenze specifiche delle materie e alle capacit\u00e0 di gestione della classe, gli educatori avranno bisogno di: Competenze digitali generali per utilizzare e applicare le tecnologie digitali come qualsiasi cittadino 9 per quanto riguarda l'informazione e l'alfabetizzazione digitale, la comunicazione e la collaborazione, la creazione di contenuti digitali, la sicurezza e il problem solving. e competenze per fare un valido uso didattico di queste tecnologie digitali. Una sfida specifica dell'introduzione dell'IA nell'istruzione e della preparazione degli studenti a un contesto alimentato dall'IA \u00e8 stata presentata dall'UNESCO nel 2019 10 : \" Preparare gli insegnanti a un'istruzione alimentata dall'IA, preparando al contempo l'IA a comprendere l'istruzione, anche se questa deve comunque essere una strada a doppio senso: gli insegnanti devono apprendere nuove competenze digitali per utilizzare l'IA in modo pedagogico e significativo e gli sviluppatori di IA devono imparare come lavorano gli insegnanti e creare soluzioni che siano sostenibili in ambienti reali. \" [deepl translation] Nei seguenti moduli di questo corso online, intendiamo aiutare a capire cos'\u00e8 l'IA e le tecnologie che ne sono alla base, a essere consapevoli dei benefici e dei rischi per agire in modo informato ed efficace come insegnanti e a interrogarsi sull'impatto dei sistemi di IA sull'apprendimento, l'insegnamento e l'educazione.

Questa tendenza \u00e8 aumentata solo in seguito alla chiusura delle scuole COVID-19. Tuttavia, rimangono scarse le prove su come l'IA possa migliorare i risultati dell'apprendimento e se possa aiutare gli scienziati e i professionisti dell'apprendimento a comprendere meglio come avviene un apprendimento efficace 4 . Inoltre, dobbiamo ancora esplorare il potenziale dell'IA nel monitoraggio dei risultati dell'apprendimento in diversi contesti e nella valutazione delle competenze, in particolare quelle acquisite in contesti non formali e informali \" . [deepl translation] \"L'IA ha anche il potenziale per facilitare nuovi approcci alla valutazione, come la valutazione adattiva e continua abilitata dall'IA 5 . Tuttavia, \u00e8 importante riconoscere fin da subito che l'uso dell'IA per l'apprendimento e la valutazione solleva anche diverse preoccupazioni che devono ancora essere affrontate in modo adeguato. Tra queste, le preoccupazioni relative al loro approccio alla pedagogia, la mancanza di prove solide della loro efficacia e del loro potenziale impatto sul ruolo degli insegnanti, nonch\u00e9 questioni etiche pi\u00f9 ampie 6 7 .\" [deepl translation] \" Molte applicazioni di IA rivolte agli insegnanti mirano ad aiutarli a ridurre il carico di lavoro automatizzando compiti come la valutazione, il rilevamento dei plagi, la somministrazione e il feedback. Questo, si sostiene spesso, dovrebbe liberare tempo per gli insegnanti da investire in altri compiti, come fornire un supporto pi\u00f9 efficace ai singoli studenti. \" [deepl translation] Come possiamo garantire un uso etico, inclusivo ed equo dell'IA nell'istruzione? \"L'uso etico, inclusivo ed equo dell'IA nell'istruzione ha un impatto su ciascuno degli Obiettivi di sviluppo sostenibile.

Quante conoscenze dovrebbero avere gli educatori sull'IA per poter agire in modo informato ed efficace come educatori?

Gli autori del rapporto del Joint Research Center sottolineano che, oltre alle conoscenze pedagogiche generali, alle conoscenze specifiche delle materie e alle capacit\u00e0 di gestione della classe, gli educatori avranno bisogno di: Competenze digitali generali per utilizzare e applicare le tecnologie digitali come qualsiasi cittadino 9 per quanto riguarda l'informazione e l'alfabetizzazione digitale, la comunicazione e la collaborazione, la creazione di contenuti digitali, la sicurezza e il problem solving. e competenze per fare un valido uso didattico di queste tecnologie digitali.

Il termine \"intelligenza artificiale\" \u00e8 stato usato per la prima volta nel 1955 da McCarthy & al. 2 per descrivere la \" scienza e l'ingegneria della creazione di macchine intelligenti, in particolare di programmi informatici intelligenti \". Nel 1968, un altro padre dell'IA, Marvin Minsky, ha proposto una definizione sintetica di IA, sostenendo che si tratta della \" scienza di far fare alle macchine cose che richiederebbero intelligenza se fatte da uomini \" 3 . Da allora, l'espressione \"intelligenza artificiale\" \u00e8 spesso usata per riferirsi ad algoritmi che simulano o condividono alcune delle capacit\u00e0 di intelligenza degli esseri viventi. A livello europeo, il gruppo di esperti di alto livello sull'intelligenza artificiale propone la seguente definizione dettagliata, a cui si fa comunemente riferimento nei lavori della Commissione europea 4 : \"I sistemi di intelligenza artificiale (IA) sono sistemi software (ed eventualmente anche hardware) progettati dall'uomo che, dato un obiettivo complesso, agiscono nella dimensione fisica o digitale percependo l'ambiente circostante attraverso l'acquisizione di dati, interpretando i dati strutturati o non strutturati raccolti, ragionando sulla conoscenza o elaborando le informazioni derivate da questi dati e decidendo le azioni migliori da intraprendere per raggiungere l'obiettivo dato. I sistemi di intelligenza artificiale possono utilizzare regole simboliche o apprendere un modello numerico, e possono anche adattare il loro comportamento analizzando come l'ambiente \u00e8 stato influenzato dalle loro azioni precedenti \" .

CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 Internazionale Una rappresentazione scientifica \u00b6 Come disciplina scientifica, l'IA copre diverse sotto-aree di competenza e le relative tecniche 4 . Alcune di esse sono spesso citate, altre sono meno conosciute. L'apprendimento automatico (di cui l'apprendimento profondo e l'apprendimento per rinforzo sono esempi specifici), il ragionamento automatico (che comprende la pianificazione, la programmazione, la rappresentazione della conoscenza e il ragionamento, la ricerca e l'ottimizzazione), e robotica (che comprende controllo, percezione, sensori e attuatori, nonch\u00e9 l'integrazione di tutte le altre tecniche nei sistemi cyber-fisici). Una panoramica semplificata delle sottodiscipline dell'IA e delle loro relazioni. Sia l'apprendimento automatico che il ragionamento includono molte altre tecniche, e la robotica include tecniche che non rientrano nell'IA. L'intera IA rientra nella disciplina dell'informatica.

Il termine \"intelligenza artificiale\" \u00e8 stato usato per la prima volta nel 1955 da McCarthy & al. 2 per descrivere la \" scienza e l'ingegneria della creazione di macchine intelligenti, in particolare di programmi informatici intelligenti \". Nel 1968, un altro padre dell'IA, Marvin Minsky, ha proposto una definizione sintetica di IA, sostenendo che si tratta della \" scienza di far fare alle macchine cose che richiederebbero intelligenza se fatte da uomini \" 3 . Da allora, l'espressione \"intelligenza artificiale\" \u00e8 spesso usata per riferirsi ad algoritmi che simulano o condividono alcune delle capacit\u00e0 di intelligenza degli esseri viventi. A livello europeo, il gruppo di esperti di alto livello sull'intelligenza artificiale propone la seguente definizione dettagliata, a cui si fa comunemente riferimento nei lavori della Commissione europea 4 : \"I sistemi di intelligenza artificiale (IA) sono sistemi software (ed eventualmente anche hardware) progettati dall'uomo che, dato un obiettivo complesso, agiscono nella dimensione fisica o digitale percependo l'ambiente circostante attraverso l'acquisizione di dati, interpretando i dati strutturati o non strutturati raccolti, ragionando sulla conoscenza o elaborando le informazioni derivate da questi dati e decidendo le azioni migliori da intraprendere per raggiungere l'obiettivo dato. I sistemi di intelligenza artificiale possono utilizzare regole simboliche o apprendere un modello numerico, e possono anche adattare il loro comportamento analizzando come l'ambiente \u00e8 stato influenzato dalle loro azioni precedenti \" .

Type: text Description: Ottenere una prima comprensione dei tipi di IA Subject: Artificial Intelligence for and by Teachers Authors: AI4T Licence: CC BY 4.0 Date: 2022-11-15 Che tipo di IA? \u00b6 In letteratura si trovano molti tipi di IA. Vediamo a cosa si riferiscono. Intelligenza Artificiale debole o forte? \u00b6 Intelligenza artificiale debole \u00c8 l'intelligenza artificiale che conosciamo oggi: \u00e8 un algoritmo che \"impara\", adattando i suoi parametri ai dati di apprendimento, e non \u00e8 dotato di capacit\u00e0 mentali e cognitive, ma \u00e8 in grado di svolgere un compito specifico in modo molto pi\u00f9 efficiente, a volte, di un essere umano. Intelligenza artificiale forte Un'intelligenza artificiale che sarebbe in grado di copiare le attitudini umane (apprendere, comprendere, comprendere, ragionare, prendere decisioni, avere una coscienza, emozioni, ecc.) Un'intelligenza artificiale cosiddetta \"forte\", in grado di essere autonoma e versatile in situazioni impreviste, \u00e8 un obiettivo scientifico. Tuttavia, al momento ci sono risultati che dimostrano che questo obiettivo ideale di intelligenza artificiale forte \u00e8 tecnicamente impossibile. Ad oggi, l'intelligenza artificiale forte non esiste, \u00e8 una credenza. Approccio simbolico o di apprendimento automatico? \u00b6 Nell'ambito dell'intelligenza artificiale debole, a cosa si riferiscono gli approcci simbolici o di apprendimento automatico? Un approccio di IA simbolica Conosciuta anche come IA \"basata su regole\" o \"classica\", si basa sulla logica e sulla conoscenza a priori fornita da esseri umani esperti. Storicamente, l'approccio simbolico \u00e8 pi\u00f9 antico e corrisponde ai sistemi esperti e, pi\u00f9 recentemente, al cosiddetto web semantico. Un approccio di apprendimento automatico (o digitale) Conosciuto anche come approccio \"digitale\", si basa sui dati e sull'apprendimento. L'approccio numerico o Machine Learning (ML) comprende le reti neurali artificiali e l'apprendimento profondo quando ci sono diversi strati di tali unit\u00e0 di calcolo 1 . \u00c8 diventato efficace pi\u00f9 di recente ed \u00e8 questo approccio che ci permette di trascrivere automaticamente i testi che dettiamo o di riconoscere gli oggetti nelle immagini. Richiede molti dati e si basa su approcci statistici. Il rapporto tra intelligenza artificiale, reti neurali e apprendimento profondo (tradotto con DeepL)- Source: AI and education: Guidance for policy-makers, UNESCO, 2021 Approccio di apprendimento supervisionato o non supervisionato? \u00b6 Nell'ambito degli approcci all'apprendimento automatico, i sistemi di IA sono di due tipi, a seconda del modo in cui vengono utilizzati i dati per addestrarli: 2 Apprendimento supervisionato \"L'apprendimento supervisionato si riferisce all'uso di dati etichettati - come immagini che dicono se contengono o meno gatti - per addestrare gli algoritmi. Questi approcci elaborano i propri metodi per prevedere come le immagini dovrebbero essere etichettate \" . [deepl translation] Apprendimento non supervisionato \"L'apprendimento non supervisionato pu\u00f2 essere utilizzato quando non sono disponibili dati etichettati di buona qualit\u00e0. \u00c8 in grado di trovare nuovi cluster e associazioni all'interno dei dati che altrimenti non sarebbero stati identificati o etichettati dall'uomo. Poich\u00e9 le etichette sono spesso incomplete o imprecise, molte applicazioni, come i sistemi di raccomandazione dei contenuti, combinano approcci di ML supervisionati e non supervisionati \" . [deepl translation] Molti meccanismi di intelligenza artificiale oggi funzionano attraverso l'apprendimento supervisionato. Per descriverne il funzionamento, immaginiamo di voler insegnare a un'intelligenza artificiale a riconoscere un gatto in un'immagine. Per farlo, forniremo molti dati, cio\u00e8 molte immagini in cui si vede un gatto e molte immagini in cui non si vede alcun gatto, in modo che il calcolo aggiusti i suoi parametri per dare un valore in uscita corrispondente alla presenza o meno del felino. Tutte queste immagini costituiscono i dati di input e il risultato atteso, la presenza o meno del gatto nell'immagine, i dati di output. Questi dati di \"input\" e \"output\" sono le uniche informazioni fornite per l'addestramento. Il meccanismo di calcolo deve quindi regolare i parametri interni (come le manopole di controllo di una macchina fotografica) per determinare la presenza o meno di un gatto nell'immagine. La prima volta verr\u00e0 fornito un risultato casuale e quindi molto probabilmente falso, poi a poco a poco il meccanismo osserver\u00e0 gli errori e con prove successive regoler\u00e0 i parametri per ridurli. Questo processo \u00e8 noto come apprendimento automatico. Di fatto, molte applicazioni di IA utilizzano il ML e quasi sempre un po' di IA simbolica in background. Ad esempio, molte applicazioni di chatbot sono pre-programmate con regole definite dall'uomo su come rispondere alle domande previste. \u00c8 un tema di ricerca attuale quello di vedere come combinare gli approcci simbolici e di apprendimento automatico.

Type: text Description: Una prima comprensione di cosa sono i dati e di come vengono utilizzati nell'IA. Subject: Artificial Intelligence for and by Teachers Authors: AI4T Laurent Romary - Inria Licence: CC BY 4.0 Date: 2022-11-15 Che cosa sono i dati? \u00b6 Il ruolo dei dati in un sistema di IA \u00b6 Nel senso digitale generale, i dati corrispondono alle informazioni utilizzate, elaborate e generate dal software in un sistema informatico. Non esiste AI senza dati. I dati svolgono un ruolo centrale in tutti i processi di apprendimento automatico, poich\u00e9 vengono utilizzati sia per l'addestramento che per i test. Si presentano anche sotto forma di parametri utilizzati per gestire i processi di formazione. Infine, il sistema di IA \u00e8 una combinazione di una certa architettura software con tutti i parametri addestrati, il cosiddetto modello, che \u00e8 anche un dato. Comprendere il ruolo dei dati nei sistemi di IA e il modo in cui vengono selezionati, documentati e diffusi \u00e8 essenziale per poter valutare il comportamento di un sistema di IA. Questo \u00e8 importante in termini di riproducibilit\u00e0 o per confrontare due diversi sistemi di IA. Nel mondo dell'elaborazione del linguaggio naturale, ad esempio, la disponibilit\u00e0 di grandi quantit\u00e0 di dati parlati e scritti \u00e8 fondamentale per le prestazioni dei correttori ortografici, della predizione nei motori di ricerca o, naturalmente, della traduzione automatica. I dati vengono utilizzati per costruire i cosiddetti modelli linguistici, che alimentano ulteriori processi con rappresentazioni statistiche di combinazioni di parole o frasi. La sostenibilit\u00e0 dei sistemi di IA dipende quindi strettamente dai metodi di gestione dei dati utilizzati nella loro progettazione. Dati per sistemi di IA supervisionati e non supervisionati \u00b6 Come abbiamo gi\u00e0 visto, i sistemi di IA sono di due tipi, a seconda del modo in cui i dati vengono utilizzati per addestrarli. I sistemi supervisionati si basano sulla fornitura di input e dei corrispondenti output previsti. L'addestramento consiste quindi nell'insegnare al sistema a generare l'output pi\u00f9 probabile a partire da input sconosciuti. I dati possono essere ottenuti in vari modi. Ad esempio, un database di immagini in cui ogni immagine \u00e8 associata a parole chiave o una raccolta di documenti digitalizzati che sono stati trascritti da annotatori (cfr. figura seguente). Figura: Trascrizione automatica di una lettera di Paul D'Estournelles (per gentile concessione di F. Chiffoleau, Coll. Archives de la Sarthe) I sistemi di intelligenza artificiale basati sull'addestramento non supervisionato non saranno progettati per un comportamento specifico, ma per sopportare le propriet\u00e0 statistiche dei dati di addestramento. \u00c8 il caso, ad esempio, di modelli linguistici come il BERT, che tendono ad associare posizioni simili in uno spazio matematico a parole che hanno lo stesso comportamento sintattico o semantico, osservato grazie a un gran numero di frasi campione per ogni parola. Tali modelli sono ad esempio molto bravi a prevedere i sinonimi o le parole successive di una determinata sequenza. Fonti - selezione, documentazione, preparazione, annotazione \u00b6 La progettazione di un sistema di IA si basa essenzialmente sulla corretta progettazione dell'insieme di dati utilizzati per l'addestramento. Tra i vari fattori che entrano in gioco possiamo citare la rilevanza dei dati per il compito da svolgere, la dimensione dei dati che dovrebbe corrispondere alla complessit\u00e0 dell'architettura del software di IA --- pi\u00f9 parametri matematici si devono addestrare, pi\u00f9 dati sono necessari --- e la variet\u00e0 di campioni che dovrebbe riflettere la complessit\u00e0 del compito. A seconda delle fonti di dati, questi devono essere selezionati e spesso ripuliti prima di essere immessi nel processo di addestramento. Se prendiamo ad esempio l'addestramento di un modello linguistico sulla base di contenuti web, i vari campioni devono essere ordinati in base alla lingua effettiva, privati del codice web che li accompagna (HTML, Javascript ecc.) ed eventualmente rimescolati per evitare violazioni del copyright. Un buon esempio di preparazione dei dati \u00e8 la progettazione del corpus OSCAR 1 . La progettazione di dati annotati per sistemi di intelligenza artificiale supervisionati \u00e8 pi\u00f9 complessa, poich\u00e9 comporta la progettazione di uno schema di annotazione, l'organizzazione di campagne di annotazione e il controllo della qualit\u00e0 dei dati annotati, ad esempio valutando l'accordo tra gli annotatori sugli stessi dati. Nel complesso, \u00e8 essenziale che il processo di progettazione sia ben documentato per poter risalire alla fonte di eventuali comportamenti errati nel sistema addestrato risultante. Sistemi di intelligenza artificiale distorti \u00b6 Come appena accennato, il comportamento di un sistema di intelligenza artificiale riflette da vicino la natura dei dati che sono stati utilizzati per addestrarlo. Questo, a sua volta, pu\u00f2 indurre tutta una serie di possibili distorsioni che possono derivare dalla selezione dei set di dati. Per esempio, un modello linguistico addestrato solo su articoli di giornale coprir\u00e0 tipi di espressioni e argomenti completamente diversi rispetto a uno per il quale sono stati scelti contenuti di letteratura o di social network. Allo stesso modo, i sistemi di generazione di immagini rifletteranno la dimensione e la variet\u00e0 dei database di immagini di partenza (ad esempio, opere artistiche) che sono stati considerati. Nel caso dei sistemi supervisionati, un pregiudizio specifico pu\u00f2 derivare dal modo in cui sono state progettate le etichette di annotazione e dal modo in cui gli annotatori, con il loro background culturale, interpreteranno i dati. Se, ad esempio, si vuole identificare l'incitamento all'odio sui social network, il modo in cui i sentimenti vengono interpretati dagli annotatori pu\u00f2 variare in base all'et\u00e0, alla cultura e ai sentimenti personali degli annotatori nei confronti del materiale da annotare. In definitiva, bisogna sempre tenere presente che i sistemi di IA sono per loro natura molto conservativi per quanto riguarda i dati di addestramento e quindi le osservabili esistenti. Non ci si pu\u00f2 aspettare alcun tipo di creativit\u00e0 da un sistema di IA. Hosting, pooling, distribuzione dei dati \u00b6 A causa delle dimensioni e della possibile complessit\u00e0 dei dati di addestramento dei sistemi di IA e dei modelli risultanti, sono state avviate diverse iniziative per consentirne l'hosting e la distribuzione. Gli insiemi di dati e i modelli aperti possono essere ospitati in archivi specializzati (ad esempio, l'image data resource 2 ) o in archivi generici nazionali o internazionali (ad esempio, Zenodo 3 ). Tali archivi forniscono solitamente l'infrastruttura necessaria per la gestione della paternit\u00e0, delle licenze, delle versioni e dell'archiviazione dei contenuti. Nel caso di attivit\u00e0 complesse, in cui diversi team lavorano in parallelo all'annotazione di una variet\u00e0 di campioni di dati, alcune iniziative fungono da cataloghi per le fonti di dati corrispondenti. \u00c8 il caso, ad esempio, dell'iniziativa HTR United 4 che raccoglie i metadati dei documenti annotati per il riconoscimento del testo (scritto a mano).

Nel tipo di problema \"Classificazione\", l'obiettivo \u00e8 separare i punti di colore blu da quelli di colore arancione. Un'applicazione di questo tipo di problema \u00e8, ad esempio, un algoritmo di classificazione delle foto. Nell'esempio seguente, c'\u00e8 un input (caratteristica) che separa i punti in orizzontale e un altro che li separa in verticale. Combinando questi due input, si ottiene una separazione obliqua. Il risultato (output) si adatta bene al tipo di dati scelti. Flusso tensoriale vista parco giochi TensorFlow: alcune spiegazioni prima di provare la simulazione di una rete neurale \u00b6 Fonte: traduzione da sito web francese di Pixees Che cos'\u00e8 una rete neurale e come funziona? Una rete neurale \u00e8 un meccanismo generico composto da piccole unit\u00e0 (pseudo-neuroni) collegate tra loro. Ogni unit\u00e0 esegue un'operazione molto semplice: prende i valori in ingresso, li combina in modo molto semplice (una semplice media con coefficienti) e applica una trasformazione al risultato (ad esempio, mantiene solo i valori positivi). I coefficienti utilizzati per ponderare la media sono i parametri di questo algoritmo. \u00c8 la combinazione di un numero molto, molto elevato di queste unit\u00e0 che consente di eseguire operazioni molto complesse. Una rete di tali \"neuroni\" si ottiene accumulando diversi strati di tali unit\u00e0. L'input \u00e8 costituito dai dati che vogliamo elaborare. Questi vengono trasformati attraverso tutti gli strati e l'ultimo strato fornisce come output una previsione su questi dati, ad esempio per rilevare la presenza di un volto in un'immagine. La rete neurale \u00e8 quindi una funzione parametrizzata con molti coefficienti (chiamati \"pesi\") ed \u00e8 la scelta di questi pesi che definisce l'elaborazione effettuata. Dove sono i neuroni in TensorFlow? Nell'interfaccia web di TensorFlow \u00e8 possibile creare facilmente una rete di una dozzina di neuroni, ciascuno con un numero di parametri compreso tra 3 e 10. Il risultato calcolato dipende quindi da centinaia di parametri. L'output calcolato dipende quindi da centinaia di parametri oltre alle due coordinate (x,y) del punto di ingresso. Nell'interfaccia, ogni quadrato rappresenta un neurone e il colore del pixel di coordinate (x,y) nel quadrato rappresenta l'uscita del neurone quando si mette (x,y) in ingresso alla rete. Se c'\u00e8 un solo neurone in uscita, viene rappresentato con un quadrato pi\u00f9 grande a destra della rete. I parametri della rete sono inizializzati con valori casuali. Ma come si imparano i pesi? L'apprendimento supervisionato consiste nel fornire esempi di dati con la soluzione da trovare, in modo da addestrare la rete a regolare i pesi come richiesto.

Una rete neurale \u00e8 un meccanismo generico composto da piccole unit\u00e0 (pseudo-neuroni) collegate tra loro. Ogni unit\u00e0 esegue un'operazione molto semplice: prende i valori in ingresso, li combina in modo molto semplice (una semplice media con coefficienti) e applica una trasformazione al risultato (ad esempio, mantiene solo i valori positivi). I coefficienti utilizzati per ponderare la media sono i parametri di questo algoritmo. \u00c8 la combinazione di un numero molto, molto elevato di queste unit\u00e0 che consente di eseguire operazioni molto complesse. Una rete di tali \"neuroni\" si ottiene accumulando diversi strati di tali unit\u00e0. L'input \u00e8 costituito dai dati che vogliamo elaborare. Questi vengono trasformati attraverso tutti gli strati e l'ultimo strato fornisce come output una previsione su questi dati, ad esempio per rilevare la presenza di un volto in un'immagine. La rete neurale \u00e8 quindi una funzione parametrizzata con molti coefficienti (chiamati \"pesi\") ed \u00e8 la scelta di questi pesi che definisce l'elaborazione effettuata. Dove sono i neuroni in TensorFlow? Nell'interfaccia web di TensorFlow \u00e8 possibile creare facilmente una rete di una dozzina di neuroni, ciascuno con un numero di parametri compreso tra 3 e 10. Il risultato calcolato dipende quindi da centinaia di parametri. L'output calcolato dipende quindi da centinaia di parametri oltre alle due coordinate (x,y) del punto di ingresso. Nell'interfaccia, ogni quadrato rappresenta un neurone e il colore del pixel di coordinate (x,y) nel quadrato rappresenta l'uscita del neurone quando si mette (x,y) in ingresso alla rete. Se c'\u00e8 un solo neurone in uscita, viene rappresentato con un quadrato pi\u00f9 grande a destra della rete. I parametri della rete sono inizializzati con valori casuali. Ma come si imparano i pesi? L'apprendimento supervisionato consiste nel fornire esempi di dati con la soluzione da trovare, in modo da addestrare la rete a regolare i pesi come richiesto. Nell'esempio della figura precedente, si tratta di una serie di punti in un quadrato, ciascuno con un colore previsto (blu o arancione), con l'obiettivo di prevedere il colore del punto in una determinata posizione.

I pregiudizi nei dati e negli algoritmi \u00b6 Come per qualsiasi sistema digitale, i dati utilizzati nelle piattaforme basate sull'IA provengono da fonti diverse e hanno formati multipli. Sono portatori di diversi tipi di distorsioni 2 . Le distorsioni dei dati sono principalmente di tipo statistico. Ne elenchiamo alcuni. La bias dei dati \u00e8 tipicamente presente nei valori dei dati. Ad esempio, un algoritmo di reclutamento addestrato su un database in cui gli uomini sono sovrarappresentati escluder\u00e0 le donne. Lo stereotype bias \u00e8 la tendenza ad agire in riferimento al gruppo sociale di appartenenza. Ad esempio, uno studio dimostra che le donne tendono a cliccare sulle offerte di lavoro che ritengono pi\u00f9 facili da ottenere in quanto donne. L' bias delle variabili omesse (bias di modellazione o di codifica) \u00e8 un bias dovuto alla difficolt\u00e0 di rappresentare o codificare un fattore nei dati. Ad esempio, poich\u00e9 \u00e8 difficile trovare criteri concreti per misurare l'intelligenza emotiva, questa dimensione \u00e8 assente dagli algoritmi di reclutamento. Il bias di selezione \u00e8 a sua volta dovuto alle caratteristiche del campione selezionato per trarre conclusioni. Ad esempio, una banca utilizzer\u00e0 i dati interni per ricavare un punteggio di credito, concentrandosi su coloro che hanno o non hanno ottenuto un prestito, ma ignorando coloro che non hanno mai avuto bisogno di un prestito, ecc. Il pregiudizio algoritmico \u00e8 principalmente una questione di ragionamento. Tali pregiudizi sono introdotti dagli ingegneri dell'IA deliberatamente o meno. Il gi\u00e0 citato studio del Servizio di Ricerca del Parlamento Europeo fornisce due esempi concreti: \" Si consideri un algoritmo di IA simbolico per l'esame delle domande di lavoro. Potrebbe valutare i candidati assegnando punteggi solo sulla base della loro istruzione ed esperienza. Tuttavia, se non tiene conto di fattori come il congedo di maternit\u00e0 o non riconosce in modo appropriato l'istruzione in istituzioni straniere come farebbero i comitati di selezione umani, l'algoritmo potrebbe discriminare le donne e i candidati stranieri \" . [deepl translation] \" Ora, consideriamo uno strumento di IA simile all'interno del paradigma ML (Machine Learning). Tali algoritmi trovano il loro modo di identificare quali tipi di candidati sono stati selezionati nei loro dati di addestramento. Se esiste una storia di pregiudizi strutturali in queste selezioni, ad esempio la discriminazione razziale, l'algoritmo pu\u00f2 impararli. Anche quando i dati relativi alla nazionalit\u00e0 o all'etnia vengono rimossi dai dati, l'algoritmo ML \u00e8 abile nel trovare proxy per i modelli sottostanti in altri dati, come le lingue, i codici postali o le scuole, che possono essere buoni predittori dell'etnia \". [deepl translation] I tre aspetti del rischio algoritmico \u00b6 Il rischio algoritmico pu\u00f2 essere caratterizzato in tre modi 3 . In primo luogo, c'\u00e8 il confinamento algoritmico , che pu\u00f2 riguardare anche le opinioni, le conoscenze culturali o persino le pratiche commerciali. Infatti, gli algoritmi mettono l'utente di Internet di fronte agli stessi contenuti, a seconda del suo profilo e dei parametri integrati, nonostante il rispetto del principio di equit\u00e0. \u00c8 il caso dei siti di raccomandazione di notizie come Facebook o di prodotti come Amazon. Il secondo aspetto del rischio algoritmico \u00e8 legato al controllo di tutti gli aspetti della vita di un individuo , dalla regolamentazione delle informazioni per gli investitori alle sue abitudini alimentari, agli hobby o persino allo stato di salute. Questo tracciamento dell'individuo suggerisce una forma di sorveglianza che contravviene all'essenza stessa della libert\u00e0 individuale. Il terzo \u00e8 legato alla potenziale violazione dei diritti fondamentali . In particolare, la discriminazione algoritmica, definita come un trattamento sfavorevole o diseguale, rispetto ad altre persone o ad altre situazioni uguali o simili, basato su un motivo espressamente vietato dalla legge. Ci\u00f2 comprende lo studio dell'equit\u00e0 ( fairness ) degli algoritmi di classificazione (ordinamento delle persone che cercano lavoro online), di raccomandazione e di apprendimento predittivo. Il problema dei pregiudizi discriminatori indotti dagli algoritmi riguarda diversi settori, come le assunzioni online, le decisioni dei tribunali, le decisioni delle pattuglie di polizia o le ammissioni scolastiche. Come gestire i rischi legati ai dati e agli algoritmi? \u00b6 Per R. Schwartz & al. 4 , \" Il bias non \u00e8 n\u00e9 nuovo n\u00e9 unico per l'IA e non \u00e8 possibile ottenere un rischio zero di bias in un sistema di IA \". Nel frattempo, riconoscere che gli agenti di IA sono intrinsecamente soggettivi \u00e8 un prerequisito fondamentale per garantire che vengano applicati solo a compiti per i quali sono ben equipaggiati. Lo studio dell'EPRS si conclude con diverse raccomandazioni per l'utilizzo di applicazioni basate sull'IA: Comprendere i pregiudizi e la soggettivit\u00e0 Evitare applicazioni che vanno oltre le capacit\u00e0 dell'IA Evitare applicazioni con impatti indesiderati Mantenere l'autonomia umana Cercare soluzioni ai problemi, non problemi per le soluzioni Considerare ci\u00f2 che vogliamo veramente dall'IA Artificial intelligence: How does it work, why does it matter, and what can we do about it ? - Philip Boucher, Scientific Foresight Unit (STOA) - ISBN: 978-92-846-6770-3 - Union Europ\u00e9enne, 2020 \u21a9 Algorithms, Data and Bias: Public Policy Needed , Anne Bouverot, Thierry Delaporte, 2019 \u21a9 Article in French: D'o\u00f9 vient le risque ?

La bias dei dati \u00e8 tipicamente presente nei valori dei dati. Ad esempio, un algoritmo di reclutamento addestrato su un database in cui gli uomini sono sovrarappresentati escluder\u00e0 le donne. Lo stereotype bias \u00e8 la tendenza ad agire in riferimento al gruppo sociale di appartenenza. Ad esempio, uno studio dimostra che le donne tendono a cliccare sulle offerte di lavoro che ritengono pi\u00f9 facili da ottenere in quanto donne. L' bias delle variabili omesse (bias di modellazione o di codifica) \u00e8 un bias dovuto alla difficolt\u00e0 di rappresentare o codificare un fattore nei dati. Ad esempio, poich\u00e9 \u00e8 difficile trovare criteri concreti per misurare l'intelligenza emotiva, questa dimensione \u00e8 assente dagli algoritmi di reclutamento. Il bias di selezione \u00e8 a sua volta dovuto alle caratteristiche del campione selezionato per trarre conclusioni. Ad esempio, una banca utilizzer\u00e0 i dati interni per ricavare un punteggio di credito, concentrandosi su coloro che hanno o non hanno ottenuto un prestito, ma ignorando coloro che non hanno mai avuto bisogno di un prestito, ecc. Il pregiudizio algoritmico \u00e8 principalmente una questione di ragionamento. Tali pregiudizi sono introdotti dagli ingegneri dell'IA deliberatamente o meno. Il gi\u00e0 citato studio del Servizio di Ricerca del Parlamento Europeo fornisce due esempi concreti: \" Si consideri un algoritmo di IA simbolico per l'esame delle domande di lavoro. Potrebbe valutare i candidati assegnando punteggi solo sulla base della loro istruzione ed esperienza. Tuttavia, se non tiene conto di fattori come il congedo di maternit\u00e0 o non riconosce in modo appropriato l'istruzione in istituzioni straniere come farebbero i comitati di selezione umani, l'algoritmo potrebbe discriminare le donne e i candidati stranieri \" . [deepl translation] \" Ora, consideriamo uno strumento di IA simile all'interno del paradigma ML (Machine Learning). Tali algoritmi trovano il loro modo di identificare quali tipi di candidati sono stati selezionati nei loro dati di addestramento. Se esiste una storia di pregiudizi strutturali in queste selezioni, ad esempio la discriminazione razziale, l'algoritmo pu\u00f2 impararli. Anche quando i dati relativi alla nazionalit\u00e0 o all'etnia vengono rimossi dai dati, l'algoritmo ML \u00e8 abile nel trovare proxy per i modelli sottostanti in altri dati, come le lingue, i codici postali o le scuole, che possono essere buoni predittori dell'etnia \".

In primo luogo, c'\u00e8 il confinamento algoritmico , che pu\u00f2 riguardare anche le opinioni, le conoscenze culturali o persino le pratiche commerciali. Infatti, gli algoritmi mettono l'utente di Internet di fronte agli stessi contenuti, a seconda del suo profilo e dei parametri integrati, nonostante il rispetto del principio di equit\u00e0. \u00c8 il caso dei siti di raccomandazione di notizie come Facebook o di prodotti come Amazon. Il secondo aspetto del rischio algoritmico \u00e8 legato al controllo di tutti gli aspetti della vita di un individuo , dalla regolamentazione delle informazioni per gli investitori alle sue abitudini alimentari, agli hobby o persino allo stato di salute. Questo tracciamento dell'individuo suggerisce una forma di sorveglianza che contravviene all'essenza stessa della libert\u00e0 individuale. Il terzo \u00e8 legato alla potenziale violazione dei diritti fondamentali . In particolare, la discriminazione algoritmica, definita come un trattamento sfavorevole o diseguale, rispetto ad altre persone o ad altre situazioni uguali o simili, basato su un motivo espressamente vietato dalla legge. Ci\u00f2 comprende lo studio dell'equit\u00e0 ( fairness ) degli algoritmi di classificazione (ordinamento delle persone che cercano lavoro online), di raccomandazione e di apprendimento predittivo.

I suoi vantaggi sono la velocit\u00e0, la scalabilit\u00e0 e la coerenza del processo decisionale. Nel aumento delle decisioni, il sistema raccomanda una decisione, o pi\u00f9 alternative decisionali, agli attori umani utilizzando l'analitica prescrittiva o predittiva. I suoi vantaggi risiedono nella sinergia tra le conoscenze umane e la capacit\u00e0 dell'IA di analizzare rapidamente elevati volumi di dati e di gestire la complessit\u00e0. Nel supporto alle decisioni, la persona umana prende la decisione , con il supporto di analisi descrittive, diagnostiche o predittive.

Ogni grado pu\u00f2 coprire realt\u00e0 molto diverse. Ad esempio, l'automazione delle decisioni pu\u00f2 essere utilizzata per un'ampia gamma di scopi.

Rischio limitato : Il rischio limitato si riferisce ai sistemi di IA con specifici obblighi di trasparenza. Quando si utilizzano sistemi di IA come i chatbot, gli utenti devono essere consapevoli che stanno interagendo con una macchina, in modo da poter decidere con cognizione di causa se continuare o fare un passo indietro. Rischio minimo o nullo : La proposta consente il libero utilizzo dell'IA a rischio minimo. Ci\u00f2 include applicazioni come i videogiochi abilitati all'IA o i filtri antispam. La grande maggioranza dei sistemi di IA attualmente utilizzati nell'UE rientra in questa categoria. I 4 livelli di rischio dell'intelligenza artificiale proposti dalla legge sull'intelligenza artificiale della CE. La classificazione della formazione scolastica e professionale nella categoria ad alto rischio non significa che nessun sistema di IA debba essere utilizzato in questi campi, ma che devono essere prese ulteriori precauzioni. Il quadro normativo precedentemente citato afferma che \" i sistemi di IA ad alto rischio saranno soggetti a obblighi rigorosi prima di poter essere immessi sul mercato \" .

Type: text Description: Comprendere l'impatto dell'utilizzo di strumenti di IA per il processo decisionale e le necessarie precauzioni d'uso. Subject: Artificial Intelligence for and by Teachers Authors: AI4T AI4T Ikram Chraibi Kaadoud, ricercatore AI Licence: CC BY 4.0 Date: 2022-11-15 Siete pronti a fidarvi dell'IA per prendere decisioni? \u00b6 Tutte le decisioni prese con strumenti basati sull'IA non hanno lo stesso impatto. Per alcune decisioni automatizzate, come le \"fasi di soluzione\" suggerite a uno studente da un'applicazione per la risoluzione di problemi matematici, il rischio e il danno a lungo termine possono essere considerati piuttosto bassi. Altre decisioni, al contrario, presentano un potenziale danno e/o rischio. In questo caso occorre prendere il massimo delle precauzioni e, innanzitutto, la decisione deve essere spiegabile (perch\u00e9 questa decisione viene proposta per questa particolare situazione, per questo particolare studente o gruppo di studenti). Vediamo alcuni criteri che vengono utilizzati per \"valutare\" il processo decisionale dei sistemi basati sull'IA. Spiegabilit\u00e0 \u00b6 Spiegabilit\u00e0 - uno dei 7 requisiti chiave per un'IA affidabile: \" La spiegabilit\u00e0 riguarda la capacit\u00e0 di spiegare sia i processi tecnici di un sistema di IA sia le relative decisioni umane (ad esempio, le aree di applicazione di un sistema). La spiegabilit\u00e0 tecnica richiede che le decisioni prese da un sistema di IA possano essere comprese e tracciate dagli esseri umani \" [deepl translation] 1 . Nel campo dell'istruzione, ci\u00f2 significa che in qualsiasi strumento decisionale di IA, il modo in cui viene proposta una decisione e l'interazione umana coinvolta sono elementi che devono essere accessibili. Questo requisito \u00e8 pi\u00f9 o meno facile da soddisfare, ma per alcune tecnologie di IA la spiegabilit\u00e0 non \u00e8 cos\u00ec semplice da fornire. Ad esempio, nel caso delle reti neurali con molti strati, le spiegazioni possono essere difficili da rendere. Per questo motivo si sta sviluppando una nuova area dell'IA: l'IA spiegabile o XAI, definita come un \" intelligenza artificiale in cui gli esseri umani possono comprendere le decisioni o le previsioni fatte dall'IA. Si contrappone al concetto di \"scatola nera\" dell'apprendimento automatico, in cui nemmeno i progettisti sono in grado di spiegare perch\u00e9 l'IA sia arrivata a una determinata decisione \" [deepl translation] 2 . Interpretabilit\u00e0 \u00b6 Le previsioni fatte con alcune tecniche di IA sono pi\u00f9 facili da interpretare di altre. Una previsione fatta da un albero decisionale, ad esempio, \u00e8 spiegabile. Ma non sempre si tratta delle previsioni pi\u00f9 interessanti. All'estremit\u00e0 opposta dello spettro di spiegabilit\u00e0 c'\u00e8 il Deep learning, che pu\u00f2 essere difficile da spiegare, ma i cui risultati possono essere molto pi\u00f9 significativi di quelli ottenuti con un'IA altamente spiegabile. Figura 1: Meccanismi di intelligenza artificiale e interpretabilit\u00e0. Adattato da Mooc IAI / Ikram Chraibi Kaadoud - CC.BY.SA 2.0. Pertanto, il supporto decisionale fornito da strumenti a bassa interpretabilit\u00e0 pu\u00f2 essere pi\u00f9 significativo di quello fornito da strumenti ad alta interpretabilit\u00e0.

Particularly in view of their many implications for education. 1 - Understanding ChatGPT \u00b6 To give you a better idea of what these language models are, The AI4T team wante dto share with you the work of the Flowers team (Inria Centre at the University of Bordeaux) which carries out scientific research in the field of developmental artificial intelligence. In particular, it is interested in computer modelling of human learning mechanisms, and the role of curiosity and language in cognitive development. It is also studying the properties of the major language models (ChatGPT, Mistral, etc), and developing methods that will enable them to be better anchored in the real world. The team is also studying applications of this work in the field of educational technologies, as well as to help scientists (physicists, biologists, etc.) explore and better understand new systems (materials, self-organising chemical reactions, etc.). Episode#1: How do language models work? \u00b6 \u00ab How does ChatGPT work? An overview in less than 5 minutes \u00bb (in English) Synopsis: This video is an introduction to large language models which are the basis for tools like ChatGPT or Bard. They are intended for the general public (for instance students and professors in middle and high school, and more generally anyone not accustomed to computer science or AI). This is a 5-minute overview answering these questions: - How are these models \"trained\"? - On which type and amount of data are they trained, and what is the impact of the size of the training corpus? - Which types of tasks are they capable of doing, and how can we ask them to perform those tasks? - What are their main usages in society? - What are their limitations and biases? What social issues? - Which organizations develop these models? Are there \"open-sourced\" ones ?. It's aimed at a wide audience, including students and teachers in secondary schools. Episode#2: How to get a language model to perform a task? \u00b6 \u00ab Prompting, or the art of making yourself understood by ChatGPT: Explained in 5 minutes \u00bb (in English) Synopsis: Language Models, such as ChatGPT or Bard, have demonstrated impressive capabilities for a wide range of tasks. However, they also have numerous limitations and weaknesses! In this video, we explain the main ones: - Language Models are trained on data of varying quality and origin. The selection of this data is often not precisely controlled. - This data, and thus the Language Models, can contain \"biases\", meaning an automatic way of thinking that is not based on reasoning or facts. These biases can be unfair and reinforce stereotypes. If these biases are not controlled, they will be reflected in the output and usage of these models. ... Episode#3: Limits and weaknesses of language models \u00b6 \u00ab What are the limits of ChatGPT? Explained in 5 minutes \u00bb (in English) Synopsis: Language models such as ChatGPT or Bard have shown impressive capabilities for a wide variety of tasks. However, they also have many limitations and weaknesses! Episode#4: The strengths of language models \u00b6 \u00ab The strengths of language models \u00bb (in French - English version soon available) Synopsis: This video presents the main strengths of language models such as ChatGPT or Bard. Despite certain weaknesses, they also possess a large number of strengths, such as : - their ability to analyze a given context to provide an appropriate response to a task - their use of external tools (e.g. Wikipedia) - the wide range of data on which they have been trained - their ability to produce basic reasoning - their \"common sense\" in certain contexts - their ability to help us come up with creative ideas Episode#5 : advanced prompting and reasoning \u00b6 \u00ab Advanced prompting and reasoning \u00bb (in French - English version soon available) Synopsis : This video shows how language models such as ChatGPT or Bard are able to hold simple reasonings to solve a given problem. However, it is sometimes necessary to use various advanced prompts techniques to help them organise such reasoning. Some of these techniques (e.g. thought chains) are presented here; then the origin and limits of these reasoning abilities are discussed. Episode#6 : Language model applications \u00b6 \u00ab Language model applications \u00bb (in French) Synopsis : Language models such as ChatGPT or Bard are becoming increasingly powerful and are being used in more and more areas. In this video, we look at the possible applications of these tools in areas such as work, health, education and language preservation. Episode#7 : Language model and tools \u00b6 \u00ab Language model and tools \u00bb (in French) Synopsis : Language models such as ChatGPT or Gemini are capable of performing a wide variety of tasks to meet their user's needs. To make the most of their skills, they can be made to manipulate tools when writing their response. Licence and citation \u00b6 This video series has a Creative Commons CC-BY licence.

Enhancing Understanding with Easy-to-Read and Understand (FALC) \u00b6 Principle: FALC (in french Facile \u00e0 Lire et \u00e0 Comprendre, in english easy to read and understand ) simplifies vocabulary, syntax, and text formatting to make content accessible to students with reading or comprehension difficulties or cognitive disabilities. AI can automate this reformulation while preserving the educational meaning. Application example: A teacher can ask an AI to reformulate exercise instructions or project steps according to FALC principles, improving clarity and comprehension for all students. Diversifying Learning Materials \u00b6 Principle: AI enables the delivery of content in multiple formats according to learner needs and preferences: text, image, audio, or video. This approach supports attention, autonomy, and equal access to information. Application example: From a single lesson, an AI can generate an audio version for dyslexic students, a visual diagram for visual learners, or a simplified summary for students requiring comprehension support. Training and Supporting Teachers \u00b6 Principle: The effectiveness of AI for inclusion also depends on teacher training and approach. It can be used for self-training, adjusting communication, or redesigning course materials inclusively. AI can also facilitate clearer, more considerate communication. Application example: A teacher can use AI to reformulate a message for a student or family to make it more accessible, or to adapt an activity without disrupting group dynamics.

Sources and bibliographical references An important work is to be done in order to complement or replace ressources in English mentioned in the Mooc. Here are two solutions we adopted within the project. Where no substitution is possible: maintenance of the original resource in english (as for example, documents as the AI Watch, JRC publications, aso.) Where an alternative resource exists, it can be listed alongside the original resource. In order to be as close as possible to the local context, the addition of references in the target languages is recommended. Reminder about translation quality /accuracy The translated text are generated by DeepL from one version of the Mooc (we recommand using the english version as a base for further translation). Adjustments to improve the quality of the translation may be required and first proofreading must be carried out; sometimes DeepL interprets signs (such as \"*\") incorrectly and there may be discrepancies in the translation (one or more elements of the text have remained in the source language). A first \"formal clean-up\" of the translation is therefore useful before moving on to the substantive proofreading.","title":"3.2.2 Step 2.2 - Proofreading Texts"},{"location":"it/3-Build-your-own-training/3-2-Step-2-Translating-the-mooc-resources/3-2-2-Step-2-2.html#where-to-find-the-texts-of-the-mooc-to-proofread-and-correct","text":"All texts, images and activities of the 4 Modules with Presentation and Conclusion Modules are available in the GitHub repository you have created in Step 2-1: \"Creating and translating texts\" ).

Here are two solutions we adopted within the project. Where no substitution is possible: maintenance of the original resource in english (as for example, documents as the AI Watch, JRC publications, aso.) Where an alternative resource exists, it can be listed alongside the original resource. In order to be as close as possible to the local context, the addition of references in the target languages is recommended. Reminder about translation quality /accuracy The translated text are generated by DeepL from one version of the Mooc (we recommand using the english version as a base for further translation). Adjustments to improve the quality of the translation may be required and first proofreading must be carried out; sometimes DeepL interprets signs (such as \"*\") incorrectly and there may be discrepancies in the translation (one or more elements of the text have remained in the source language). A first \"formal clean-up\" of the translation is therefore useful before moving on to the substantive proofreading.","title":"What to check"},{"location":"it/3-Build-your-own-training/3-2-Step-2-Translating-the-mooc-resources/3-2-3-Step-2-3.html","text":"All videos of the Mooc are hosted on the YouTube channel of the project https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBd_PgP_BdhmgdSzz5d83vQ Videos are available in different languages \u00b6 Within the AI4T project lifespan, most of the Mooc's videos have been produced in the 5 languages of the partnership (ie : English, German, French, Italian & Slovenian) with different solutions depending on the nature / origin of the video.

Type: text Description: Einordnung der Fortbildung in den europ\u00e4ischen Rahmen Subject: Artificial Intelligence for and by Teachers Authors: AI4T Licence: CC BY 4.0 Date: 2022-11-15 Was ist das Ziel dieser Fortbildung? \u00b6 K\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz in der Bildung \u00b6 Diese Schulung \u00fcber k\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz f\u00fcr Lehrer und die gesamte Bildungsgemeinschaft wurde auf europ\u00e4ischer Ebene in 5 L\u00e4ndern erprobt: Frankreich, Irland, Italien, Luxemburg und Slowenien. Das Ziel dieser Fortbildung besteht aus mehreren Ebenen: Entmystifizierung und Verst\u00e4ndnis von KI ; Experimentieren und die digitalen Bildungsressourcen mit KI-Diensten sinnvoll nutzen; Zur Entwicklung digitaler Kompetenzen bei allen Lehrkr\u00e4ften und Sch\u00fclern beizutragen, die \u00fcber die technischen oder regulatorischen Aspekte der KI hinaus auch eine ethische Dimension umfassen. Die erste Ebene \" entmystifizieren und verstehen \" KI im Bildungsbereich zielt darauf ab, enthusiastische oder \u00e4ngstliche Diskurse \u00fcber KI zu \u00fcberwinden, um nicht nur das Potenzial zu sehen oder den Einsatz von KI aufzugeben, noch bevor man sie erlebt hat und ein Feedback erh\u00e4lt. Es f\u00fchrt zur Identifizierung von KI-Typen und Beispielen von KI-Algorithmen, um die allgemeinen Prinzipien zu erkl\u00e4ren und ein Verst\u00e4ndnis f\u00fcr die beabsichtigten Wirkungen, m\u00f6glichen Verzerrungen, erzielten Vorteile oder unannehmbaren Situationen zu vermitteln. Das Projekt zielt darauf ab, einige direkte Fragen zu beantworten, wie zum Beispiel: Welche KI-Techniken sind verf\u00fcgbar und f\u00fcr die genannten Zwecke n\u00fctzlich? Welche Entwicklungen sind f\u00fcr meinen Unterrichtskontext erforderlich? Welche Unterst\u00fctzung kann sie mir geben? Welche Fragen muss ich mir stellen, um einen vern\u00fcnftigen Einstieg zu finden? Die zweite Ebene, \" experimentieren und KI sinnvoll nutzen \", zielt darauf ab, die eigenen Ziele (oder Bed\u00fcrfnisse) zu beschreiben und Ressourcen zu testen, die dem Lernen gewidmet sind, unabh\u00e4ngig davon, ob sie an den schulischen Kontext angepasst sind oder nicht, solange sie insbesondere die Vorschriften \u00fcber personenbezogene Daten einhalten. Die Idee ist, den Lehrern die M\u00f6glichkeit zu geben, den Nutzen der verwendeten Ressource zu identifizieren, zu testen und zu bewerten, und sogar die Kontexte und F\u00e4lle, in denen sie relevant ist und jene, in denen sie nicht relevant ist. Es geht auch darum, die Integration der KI-Tools in den breiteren und komplexeren Rahmen der Lernreise des Sch\u00fclers zu w\u00fcrdigen. Wie wir alle wissen, ist die Hinzuf\u00fcgung von Mikro-Learning kein Automatismus. Der Einsatz von KI f\u00fcr spezifisches Lernen ist n\u00fctzlich. Sie erm\u00f6glicht die Analyse von Lernspuren bei relativ einfachen Objekten oder die \u00dcberarbeitung von Vergessenskurven, aber sie ersetzt nicht den Kontakt und die Wertsch\u00e4tzung des Lehrers in seiner t\u00e4glichen Beziehung zu den Sch\u00fclern, die ebenfalls eine Rolle beim Lernen im Laufe der Zeit spielen. Die dritte Ebene l\u00e4dt die Teilnehmer dazu ein, sich nicht nur auf technische Fragen oder das Lernen von F\u00e4chern zu konzentrieren, sondern sich auch innerhalb ihrer Schule mit Kollegen und der Schulleitung auszutauschen und an den Aufgaben der Schule teilzuhaben, von denen die erste das Zusammenleben, die Gleichberechtigung und die Achtung der Menschenrechte ist. Wie bei allen p\u00e4dagogischen Aktivit\u00e4ten ist die ethische Dimension eine transversale Komponente. AI hebt sie umso mehr hervor, als ihre Anwendungsbereiche - insbesondere im Bildungswesen - noch zu definieren und ihre Auswirkungen zu untersuchen sind.","title":"0.1.2 Was ist das Ziel dieser Schulung?"},{"location":"de/1-Mooc/general-presentation/0-1-what-does-this-training-offer-us/0-1-2-training-objectives.html#was-ist-das-ziel-dieser-fortbildung","text":"","title":"Was ist das Ziel dieser Fortbildung?"},{"location":"de/1-Mooc/general-presentation/0-1-what-does-this-training-offer-us/0-1-2-training-objectives.html#kunstliche-intelligenz-in-der-bildung","text":"Diese Schulung \u00fcber k\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz f\u00fcr Lehrer und die gesamte Bildungsgemeinschaft wurde auf europ\u00e4ischer Ebene in 5 L\u00e4ndern erprobt: Frankreich, Irland, Italien, Luxemburg und Slowenien.

Einige dieser Websites sind auch in der Lage zu sagen, welche Filme wir uns mit unserer Familie und welche mit einer Gruppe von Freunden ansehen k\u00f6nnen. Die Frage, die wir uns stellen, lautet: Warum sollte man nicht die gleichen Strategien anwenden, um die Lernwege zu personalisieren, indem man dem Lehrer geeignete Lernressourcen f\u00fcr einen Sch\u00fcler oder eine Gruppe von Sch\u00fclern zur Verf\u00fcgung stellt? Nehmen wir ein anderes Beispiel, das auf den Aufzeichnungen auf unseren Smartphones basiert. Einige Anwendungen erm\u00f6glichen es uns, unsere Bewegungen aufzuzeichnen, die Anzahl der Schritte zu messen, die wir jeden Tag machen, die verbrannten Kalorien zu visualisieren und zu analysieren, die Leistung, die wir beim letzten Lauf erzielt haben, oder die Di\u00e4t, die wir einhalten sollten, um unsere Gewichtsziele zu erreichen. Eine weitere Frage, die wir uns stellen k\u00f6nnen, ist: W\u00e4re die Aktivit\u00e4ts\u00fcberwachung nicht auch im Unterricht n\u00fctzlich, um den Lernenden besser zu erkennen, zu verstehen und zu unterst\u00fctzen?

Betrachtet man nur die spezifischen bildungsorientierten Aufgaben, so wurden von Fengchun & al. 1 vier bedarfsorientierte Kategorien von neu entstehenden und potenziellen Anwendungen definiert: Bildungsmanagement und -vermittlung; Lernen und Bewertung; Bef\u00e4higung der Lehrkr\u00e4fte und Verbesserung des Unterrichts; und lebenslanges Lernen. Holmes & al. 2 klassifizierten die verschiedenen Arten aktueller KI-basierter Systeme f\u00fcr das Bildungswesen wie folgt. Verschiedene Arten aktueller KI-basierter Systeme f\u00fcr das Bildungswesen (aus Holmes & al. 2019) KI-bezogene Herausforderungen und Bildung \u00b6 Diese aufkommenden KI-Technologien m\u00fcssen auch im Zusammenhang mit dem Einsatz im Bildungswesen hinterfragt werden. Um die Chancen zu nutzen und die potenziellen Risiken der KI im Bildungsbereich zu mindern, wurden im UNESCO-Bericht (Fengchun & al., 2021) die folgenden Herausforderungen identifiziert: Wie kann KI zur Verbesserung der Bildung eingesetzt werden? \"In den letzten zehn Jahren hat der Einsatz von KI-Tools zur Unterst\u00fctzung oder Verbesserung des Lernens exponentiell zugenommen 3 . Dies hat sich nach den COVID-19-Schulschlie\u00dfungen noch verst\u00e4rkt. Es gibt jedoch nur wenige Belege daf\u00fcr, wie KI die Lernergebnisse verbessern kann und ob sie Lernwissenschaftlern und -praktikern helfen kann, besser zu verstehen, wie effektives Lernen abl\u00e4uft 4 . Dar\u00fcber hinaus m\u00fcssen wir noch das Potenzial der KI bei der Verfolgung von Lernergebnissen in verschiedenen Kontexten sowie bei der Bewertung von Kompetenzen, insbesondere von solchen, die in nicht-formalen und informellen Kontexten erworben wurden, erforschen. \" [deepl translation] \"Es gibt auch ein Potenzial f\u00fcr KI, um neue Bewertungsans\u00e4tze zu erleichtern, wie z. B. KI-gest\u00fctzte adaptive und kontinuierliche Bewertung 5 . Es ist jedoch wichtig, von vornherein anzuerkennen, dass der Einsatz von KI f\u00fcr das Lernen und die Bewertung auch verschiedene Bedenken aufwirft, die erst noch angemessen ber\u00fccksichtigt werden m\u00fcssen. Dazu geh\u00f6ren Bedenken hinsichtlich ihres p\u00e4dagogischen Ansatzes, das Fehlen stichhaltiger Beweise f\u00fcr ihre Wirksamkeit und ihre m\u00f6glichen Auswirkungen auf die Rolle der Lehrkr\u00e4fte sowie allgemeinere ethische Fragen 6 7 . [deepl translation] \"Viele KI-Anwendungen f\u00fcr Lehrkr\u00e4fte zielen darauf ab, die Arbeitsbelastung der Lehrkr\u00e4fte durch die Automatisierung von Aufgaben wie Bewertung, Plagiatserkennung, Verwaltung und Feedback zu verringern. Dadurch, so wird oft argumentiert, sollen die Lehrkr\u00e4fte Zeit gewinnen, die sie in andere Aufgaben investieren k\u00f6nnen, z. B. in eine effektivere Unterst\u00fctzung einzelner Sch\u00fcler. \" [deepl translation] Wie k\u00f6nnen wir den ethischen, inklusiven und gerechten Einsatz von KI in der Bildung sicherstellen? \" Der ethische, integrative und gerechte Einsatz von KI in der Bildung wirkt sich auf jedes der Ziele f\u00fcr nachhaltige Entwicklung aus. Es gibt Fragen zu Daten und Algorithmen, zu p\u00e4dagogischen Entscheidungen, zur Inklusion und zur 'digitalen Kluft', zum Recht der Kinder auf Privatsph\u00e4re, Freiheit und ungehinderte Entwicklung sowie zur Gerechtigkeit in Bezug auf Geschlecht, Behinderung, sozialen und wirtschaftlichen Status, ethnischen und kulturellen Hintergrund und geografische Lage. \" [deepl translation] Wie kann die Bildung die Menschen darauf vorbereiten, mit KI zu leben und zu arbeiten? \" Wenn die Welt sicherstellen will, dass KI bestehende Ungleichheiten nicht noch versch\u00e4rft, wird es f\u00fcr jeden B\u00fcrger immer wichtiger, die M\u00f6glichkeit zu haben, ein solides Verst\u00e4ndnis von KI zu entwickeln - was sie ist, wie sie funktioniert und wie sie sich auf sein Leben auswirken k\u00f6nnte. Dies wird manchmal als \"KI-Kenntnisse\" bezeichnet. Lehrerinnen und Lehrer werden dabei eine Schl\u00fcsselrolle spielen. \" [deepl translation] \" Damit Sch\u00fcler lernen, wie sie in einer Welt, die zunehmend von KI beeinflusst wird, effektiv leben k\u00f6nnen, ist eine P\u00e4dagogik erforderlich, die mehr Gewicht auf menschliche F\u00e4higkeiten (z. B. kritisches Denken, Kommunikation, Zusammenarbeit und Kreativit\u00e4t) und die F\u00e4higkeit zur Zusammenarbeit mit allgegenw\u00e4rtigen KI-Werkzeugen im Leben, beim Lernen und bei der Arbeit legt. \" [deepl translation] Kernkompetenzen, die in der KI-\u00c4ra erforderlich sind \u00b6 Der Einsatz von KI-basierten Technologien in der Schule wirft die Frage nach den Auswirkungen des Einsatzes solcher Systeme auf die p\u00e4dagogischen F\u00e4higkeiten auf, worauf die Gemeinsame Forschungsstelle (GFS), der Dienst f\u00fcr Wissenschaft und Wissen der Europ\u00e4ischen Kommission, hinweist 8 : Inwieweit sollte die Lehrkraft oder der Nutzer \u00fcber die zugrunde liegende Technologie informiert sein? Wie viel Wissen sollten P\u00e4dagogen \u00fcber KI haben, damit sie als P\u00e4dagogen sachkundig und effektiv handeln k\u00f6nnen? Werden die heute aufkommenden Technologien die beruflichen F\u00e4higkeiten von Lehrern in Zukunft beeinflussen? Die Autoren des Berichts der Gemeinsamen Forschungsstelle betonen, dass P\u00e4dagogen neben allgemeinem p\u00e4dagogischem Wissen, fachspezifischem Wissen und F\u00e4higkeiten zur Unterrichtsverwaltung auch F\u00e4higkeiten ben\u00f6tigen werden: Allgemeine digitale Kompetenzen zur Nutzung und Anwendung digitaler Technologien wie bei jedem B\u00fcrger 9 in Bezug auf Information und digitale Kompetenz, Kommunikation und Zusammenarbeit, Erstellung digitaler Inhalte, Sicherheit und Probleml\u00f6sung und Kompetenzen f\u00fcr den p\u00e4dagogisch wertvollen Einsatz dieser digitalen Technologien. Eine besondere Herausforderung bei der Einf\u00fchrung von KI in der Bildung und der Vorbereitung von Sch\u00fclern auf einen KI-gest\u00fctzten Kontext wurde von der UNESCO im Jahr 2019 vorgestellt 10 : \" Die Lehrkr\u00e4fte auf eine KI-gest\u00fctzte Bildung vorzubereiten und gleichzeitig die KI darauf vorzubereiten, Bildung zu verstehen, wobei dies jedoch in beide Richtungen gehen muss: die Lehrkr\u00e4fte m\u00fcssen neue digitale F\u00e4higkeiten erlernen, um KI auf p\u00e4dagogisch sinnvolle Weise zu nutzen, und die KI-Entwickler m\u00fcssen lernen, wie Lehrkr\u00e4fte arbeiten und L\u00f6sungen schaffen, die in realen Umgebungen tragf\u00e4hig sind. \" [deepl translation] In den folgenden Modulen dieses Online-Kurses wollen wir dabei helfen, zu verstehen, was KI und die ihr zugrunde liegenden Technologien sind, sich der Vorteile und Risiken bewusst zu werden, um als Lehrkraft informiert und effektiv zu handeln und die Auswirkungen von KI-Systemen auf Lernen, Lehren und Bildung zu hinterfragen.

Es gibt Fragen zu Daten und Algorithmen, zu p\u00e4dagogischen Entscheidungen, zur Inklusion und zur 'digitalen Kluft', zum Recht der Kinder auf Privatsph\u00e4re, Freiheit und ungehinderte Entwicklung sowie zur Gerechtigkeit in Bezug auf Geschlecht, Behinderung, sozialen und wirtschaftlichen Status, ethnischen und kulturellen Hintergrund und geografische Lage. \" [deepl translation] Wie kann die Bildung die Menschen darauf vorbereiten, mit KI zu leben und zu arbeiten? \" Wenn die Welt sicherstellen will, dass KI bestehende Ungleichheiten nicht noch versch\u00e4rft, wird es f\u00fcr jeden B\u00fcrger immer wichtiger, die M\u00f6glichkeit zu haben, ein solides Verst\u00e4ndnis von KI zu entwickeln - was sie ist, wie sie funktioniert und wie sie sich auf sein Leben auswirken k\u00f6nnte. Dies wird manchmal als \"KI-Kenntnisse\" bezeichnet. Lehrerinnen und Lehrer werden dabei eine Schl\u00fcsselrolle spielen. \" [deepl translation] \" Damit Sch\u00fcler lernen, wie sie in einer Welt, die zunehmend von KI beeinflusst wird, effektiv leben k\u00f6nnen, ist eine P\u00e4dagogik erforderlich, die mehr Gewicht auf menschliche F\u00e4higkeiten (z.

Wie viel Wissen sollten P\u00e4dagogen \u00fcber KI haben, damit sie als P\u00e4dagogen sachkundig und effektiv handeln k\u00f6nnen? Werden die heute aufkommenden Technologien die beruflichen F\u00e4higkeiten von Lehrern in Zukunft beeinflussen? Die Autoren des Berichts der Gemeinsamen Forschungsstelle betonen, dass P\u00e4dagogen neben allgemeinem p\u00e4dagogischem Wissen, fachspezifischem Wissen und F\u00e4higkeiten zur Unterrichtsverwaltung auch F\u00e4higkeiten ben\u00f6tigen werden: Allgemeine digitale Kompetenzen zur Nutzung und Anwendung digitaler Technologien wie bei jedem B\u00fcrger 9 in Bezug auf Information und digitale Kompetenz, Kommunikation und Zusammenarbeit, Erstellung digitaler Inhalte, Sicherheit und Probleml\u00f6sung und Kompetenzen f\u00fcr den p\u00e4dagogisch wertvollen Einsatz dieser digitalen Technologien. Eine besondere Herausforderung bei der Einf\u00fchrung von KI in der Bildung und der Vorbereitung von Sch\u00fclern auf einen KI-gest\u00fctzten Kontext wurde von der UNESCO im Jahr 2019 vorgestellt 10 : \" Die Lehrkr\u00e4fte auf eine KI-gest\u00fctzte Bildung vorzubereiten und gleichzeitig die KI darauf vorzubereiten, Bildung zu verstehen, wobei dies jedoch in beide Richtungen gehen muss: die Lehrkr\u00e4fte m\u00fcssen neue digitale F\u00e4higkeiten erlernen, um KI auf p\u00e4dagogisch sinnvolle Weise zu nutzen, und die KI-Entwickler m\u00fcssen lernen, wie Lehrkr\u00e4fte arbeiten und L\u00f6sungen schaffen, die in realen Umgebungen tragf\u00e4hig sind. \" [deepl translation] In den folgenden Modulen dieses Online-Kurses wollen wir dabei helfen, zu verstehen, was KI und die ihr zugrunde liegenden Technologien sind, sich der Vorteile und Risiken bewusst zu werden, um als Lehrkraft informiert und effektiv zu handeln und die Auswirkungen von KI-Systemen auf Lernen, Lehren und Bildung zu hinterfragen.

Type: text Description: Ein erstes Verst\u00e4ndnis von KI-Typen gewinnen Subject: Artificial Intelligence for and by Teachers Authors: AI4T Licence: CC BY 4.0 Date: 2022-11-15 Welche Art von KI? \u00b6 In der Literatur sind viele KI-Typen zu finden. Schauen wir uns an, worauf sie sich beziehen. Schwache oder starke KI? \u00b6 Schwache k\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz Dies ist die k\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz, die wir heute kennen: Es handelt sich um einen Algorithmus, der \"lernt\", indem er seine Parameter an die Lerndaten anpasst, und der nicht mit mentalen und kognitiven F\u00e4higkeiten ausgestattet ist, aber in der Lage ist, eine bestimmte Aufgabe manchmal viel effizienter auszuf\u00fchren als ein Mensch. Starke k\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz Eine k\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz, die in der Lage ist, menschliche F\u00e4higkeiten zu kopieren (lernen, verstehen, begreifen, schlussfolgern, Entscheidungen treffen, ein Gewissen haben, Gef\u00fchle haben usw.). Eine so genannte \"starke\" k\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz, die in der Lage w\u00e4re, in unerwarteten Situationen autonom und vielseitig zu sein, ist ein wissenschaftliches Ziel. Gegenw\u00e4rtig gibt es jedoch Ergebnisse, die zeigen, dass dieses Idealziel einer starken k\u00fcnstlichen Intelligenz technisch unm\u00f6glich ist. Bis heute gibt es keine starke k\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz, sie ist ein Glaube. Symbolischer oder maschineller Lernansatz? \u00b6 Worauf beziehen sich innerhalb der schwachen k\u00fcnstlichen Intelligenz die Ans\u00e4tze des symbolischen oder des maschinellen Lernens? Ein symbolischer KI-Ansatz Er wird auch als \"regelbasierte\" oder \"klassische\" KI bezeichnet und basiert auf Logik und a priori Wissen, das von menschlichen Experten bereitgestellt wird. Historisch gesehen ist der symbolische Ansatz \u00e4lter und entspricht den Expertensystemen und in j\u00fcngerer Zeit dem so genannten semantischen Web. Maschinelles Lernen (oder digitaler Ansatz) Dieser auch als \"digitaler\" Ansatz bezeichnete Ansatz basiert auf Daten und Lernen. Der numerische oder maschinelle Lernansatz (ML) umfasst k\u00fcnstliche neuronale Netze und Deep Learning, wenn es mehrere Schichten solcher Recheneinheiten gibt 1 . Dieser Ansatz hat sich erst in j\u00fcngster Zeit durchgesetzt und erm\u00f6glicht es uns, diktierte Texte automatisch zu transkribieren oder Objekte auf Bildern zu erkennen. Er erfordert eine gro\u00dfe Datenmenge und basiert auf statistischen Ans\u00e4tzen.

Sie zeichnen sich dadurch aus, dass sie neue Cluster und Assoziationen innerhalb von Daten finden, die andernfalls m\u00f6glicherweise nicht von Menschen identifiziert oder etikettiert worden w\u00e4ren. Da die Kennzeichnungen oft unvollst\u00e4ndig oder ungenau sind, werden in vielen Anwendungen, wie z. B. in Empfehlungssystemen f\u00fcr Inhalte, sowohl \u00fcberwachte als auch un\u00fcberwachte ML-Ans\u00e4tze kombiniert. \" [deepl translation] Viele Mechanismen der k\u00fcnstlichen Intelligenz arbeiten heute mit \u00fcberwachtem Lernen. Um die Funktionsweise zu beschreiben, stellen wir uns vor, dass wir einer k\u00fcnstlichen Intelligenz beibringen wollen, eine Katze auf einem Bild zu erkennen. Zu diesem Zweck stellen wir viele Daten zur Verf\u00fcgung, n\u00e4mlich viele Bilder, auf denen eine Katze zu sehen ist, und viele Bilder, auf denen keine Katze zu sehen ist, so dass die Berechnung ihre Parameter anpasst, um einen Ausgabewert zu liefern, der dem Vorhandensein oder Nichtvorhandensein der Katze entspricht. Alle diese Bilder stellen die Eingabedaten dar, und das erwartete Ergebnis, ob eine Katze auf dem Bild zu sehen ist oder nicht, die Ausgabedaten. Diese \"Eingabe-\" und \"Ausgabedaten\" sind die einzigen Informationen, die f\u00fcr das Training des Systems zur Verf\u00fcgung stehen. Der Rechenmechanismus muss also interne Parameter (wie die Steuerkn\u00f6pfe einer Kamera) einstellen, um festzustellen, ob eine Katze auf dem Bild zu sehen ist oder nicht. Beim ersten Mal wird ein zuf\u00e4lliges und daher h\u00f6chstwahrscheinlich falsches Ergebnis geliefert, dann beobachtet der Mechanismus nach und nach die Fehler und passt die Parameter durch aufeinanderfolgende Versuche an, um sie zu verringern. Dieser Prozess wird als maschinelles Lernen bezeichnet. Tats\u00e4chlich nutzen viele KI-Anwendungen ML und fast immer auch symbolische KI im Hintergrund. So sind beispielsweise viele Chatbot-Anwendungen mit vom Menschen definierten Regeln f\u00fcr die Beantwortung erwarteter Fragen vorprogrammiert. Ein aktuelles Forschungsthema ist die Frage, wie sich symbolisches und maschinelles Lernen kombinieren lassen.

Type: text Description: Verschaffen Sie sich ein erstes Verst\u00e4ndnis daf\u00fcr, was Daten sind und wie sie in der KI verwendet werden. Subject: Artificial Intelligence for and by Teachers Authors: AI4T Laurent Romary - Inria Licence: CC BY 4.0 Date: 2022-11-15 Was sind Daten? \u00b6 Die Rolle von Daten in einem KI-System \u00b6 Im allgemeinen digitalen Sinne entsprechen Daten den Informationen, die von der Software in einem Computersystem verwendet, verarbeitet und erzeugt werden. Es gibt keine KI ohne Daten. Daten spielen bei allen Prozessen des maschinellen Lernens eine zentrale Rolle, da sie sowohl f\u00fcr das Training als auch f\u00fcr die Tests verwendet werden. Sie werden auch in Form von Parametern f\u00fcr die Verwaltung der Trainingsprozesse verwendet. Schlie\u00dflich ist das KI-System eine Kombination aus einer bestimmten Softwarearchitektur mit allen trainierten Parametern, dem so genannten Modell, das ebenfalls aus Daten besteht. Das Verst\u00e4ndnis der Rolle der Daten in KI-Systemen sowie der Art und Weise, wie sie ausgew\u00e4hlt, dokumentiert und verbreitet werden, ist f\u00fcr die Beurteilung des Verhaltens eines KI-Systems von wesentlicher Bedeutung. Dies ist wichtig f\u00fcr die Reproduzierbarkeit oder f\u00fcr den Vergleich zweier verschiedener KI-Systeme. In der Welt der Verarbeitung nat\u00fcrlicher Sprache beispielsweise ist die Verf\u00fcgbarkeit gro\u00dfer Mengen gesprochener und geschriebener Daten von zentraler Bedeutung f\u00fcr die Leistung von Rechtschreibpr\u00fcfungen, Vorhersagen in Suchmaschinen oder nat\u00fcrlich f\u00fcr die maschinelle \u00dcbersetzung. Sie werden verwendet, um sogenannte Sprachmodelle zu erstellen, die weitere Prozesse mit statistischen Darstellungen von Wort- oder Satzkombinationen f\u00fcttern. Die Nachhaltigkeit von KI-Systemen h\u00e4ngt also eng mit den Methoden der Datenverwaltung zusammen, die bei ihrer Entwicklung eingesetzt werden. Daten f\u00fcr \u00fcberwachte und un\u00fcberwachte KI-Systeme \u00b6 Wie wir bereits gesehen haben, gibt es zwei Arten von KI-Systemen, je nachdem, wie die Daten f\u00fcr ihr Training verwendet werden. \u00dcberwachte Systeme beruhen auf der Bereitstellung von Eingaben zusammen mit den entsprechenden beabsichtigten Ausgaben. Das Training besteht also darin, dem System beizubringen, aus unbekannten Eingaben die wahrscheinlichste Ausgabe zu erzeugen. Es gibt verschiedene M\u00f6glichkeiten, solche Daten zu erhalten. Zum Beispiel eine Bilddatenbank, in der jedes Bild mit Schl\u00fcsselw\u00f6rtern verkn\u00fcpft ist, oder eine Sammlung digitalisierter Dokumente, die von Annotatoren transkribiert wurden (siehe Abbildung unten). Abbildung: Automatische Transkription eines Briefes von Paul D'Estournelles (mit freundlicher Genehmigung von F. Chiffoleau, Coll. Archives de la Sarthe) KI-Systeme, die auf un\u00fcberwachtem Training basieren, werden nicht f\u00fcr ein bestimmtes Verhalten entwickelt, sondern um die statistischen Eigenschaften der Trainingsdaten zu ber\u00fccksichtigen. Dies ist beispielsweise bei Sprachmodellen wie BERT der Fall, die dazu neigen, W\u00f6rtern mit dem gleichen syntaktischen oder semantischen Verhalten \u00e4hnliche Positionen in einem mathematischen Raum zuzuordnen, was durch die Bereitstellung einer gro\u00dfen Anzahl von Beispiels\u00e4tzen f\u00fcr jedes Wort beobachtet wird. Solche Modelle sind zum Beispiel sehr gut in der Lage, Synonyme oder die Folgew\u00f6rter einer bestimmten Sequenz vorherzusagen. Quellen - Auswahl, Dokumentation, Aufbereitung, Annotation \u00b6 Das Design eines KI-Systems basiert im Wesentlichen auf dem richtigen Design des Datensatzes, mit dem es trainiert wird. Zu den verschiedenen Faktoren, die dabei eine Rolle spielen, geh\u00f6ren die Relevanz der Daten f\u00fcr die jeweilige Aufgabe, der Umfang der Daten, der der Komplexit\u00e4t der KI-Softwarearchitektur entsprechen sollte - je mehr mathematische Parameter zu trainieren sind, desto mehr Daten werden ben\u00f6tigt -, und die Vielfalt der Stichproben, die die Komplexit\u00e4t der Aufgabe widerspiegeln sollte. Abh\u00e4ngig von den Datenquellen m\u00fcssen die Daten ausgew\u00e4hlt und oft bereinigt werden, bevor sie in den Trainingsprozess eingespeist werden. Nehmen wir zum Beispiel das Training eines Sprachmodells auf der Grundlage von Webinhalten, so m\u00fcssen die verschiedenen Stichproben nach der tats\u00e4chlichen Sprache sortiert, vom begleitenden Webcode (HTML, Javascript usw.) befreit und m\u00f6glicherweise gemischt werden, um Urheberrechtsverletzungen zu vermeiden. Ein gutes Beispiel f\u00fcr eine solche Datenaufbereitung ist der Aufbau des OSCAR-Korpus 1 . Der Entwurf von annotierten Daten f\u00fcr \u00fcberwachte KI-Systeme ist komplexer, da er den Entwurf eines Annotationsschemas, die Organisation von Annotationskampagnen und die Kontrolle der Qualit\u00e4t der annotierten Daten umfasst, z. B. durch Bewertung der \u00dcbereinstimmung zwischen Annotatoren bei denselben Daten. Alles in allem ist es wichtig, dass der Entwurfsprozess gut dokumentiert wird, um die Quelle m\u00f6glicher Fehlverhaltensweisen im resultierenden trainierten System zur\u00fcckverfolgen zu k\u00f6nnen. Voreingenommene KI-Systeme \u00b6 Wie bereits angedeutet, spiegelt das Verhalten eines KI-Systems die Art der Daten wider, die f\u00fcr sein Training verwendet wurden. Dies wiederum kann zu einer ganzen Reihe m\u00f6glicher Verzerrungen f\u00fchren, die sich aus der zugrundeliegenden Auswahl der Datens\u00e4tze ergeben k\u00f6nnen. So wird beispielsweise ein Sprachmodell, das nur auf Zeitungsartikeln trainiert wurde, ganz andere Arten von Ausdr\u00fccken und Themen abdecken als eines, f\u00fcr das Inhalte aus der Literatur oder sozialen Netzwerken ausgew\u00e4hlt wurden. In gleicher Weise spiegeln Bilderzeugungssysteme die Gr\u00f6\u00dfe und Vielfalt der betrachteten Quellbilddatenbanken (z. B. k\u00fcnstlerische Werke) wider. Im Falle \u00fcberwachter Systeme kann eine spezifische Verzerrung aus der Art und Weise resultieren, wie die Beschriftungsetiketten gestaltet sind, sowie aus der Art und Weise, wie die Annotatoren mit ihrem eigenen kulturellen Hintergrund die Daten interpretieren werden. Wenn Sie beispielsweise Hassreden in sozialen Netzwerken identifizieren wollen, kann die Art und Weise, wie die Kommentatoren die Gef\u00fchle interpretieren, je nach Alter, Kultur und pers\u00f6nlichen Gef\u00fchlen der Kommentatoren gegen\u00fcber dem zu kommentierenden Material variieren. Alles in allem sollte man immer im Hinterkopf behalten, dass KI-Systeme konstruktionsbedingt sehr konservativ sind, was ihre Trainingsdaten und damit die vorhandenen Beobachtungen betrifft. Von einem KI-System kann man keine wirkliche Kreativit\u00e4t erwarten. Hosting, Pooling, Verteilung von Daten \u00b6 Aufgrund des Umfangs und der m\u00f6glichen Komplexit\u00e4t der Trainingsdaten in KI-Systemen sowie der daraus resultierenden Modelle wurden verschiedene Initiativen ins Leben gerufen, um deren Hosting und Verteilung zu erm\u00f6glichen. Offene Datens\u00e4tze und Modelle k\u00f6nnen in speziellen Repositories (z. B. die Bilddatenressource 2 ) oder in allgemeinen nationalen oder internationalen Repositories (z. B. Zenodo 3 ) gehostet werden. Solche Repositorien bieten in der Regel die notwendige Infrastruktur f\u00fcr die Verwaltung der Urheberschaft, Lizenzierung, Versionierung und Archivierung ihrer Inhalte. Im Falle komplexer Aufgaben, bei denen verschiedene Teams parallel an der Annotation einer Vielzahl von Datenproben arbeiten, fungieren einige Initiativen als Kataloge f\u00fcr die entsprechenden Datenquellen. Dies ist zum Beispiel bei der Initiative HTR United 4 der Fall, die Metadaten von annotierten Dokumenten f\u00fcr die (handschriftliche) Texterkennung sammelt.

Tensor Flow Spielplatz Ansicht TensorFlow: Einige Erkl\u00e4rungen, bevor Sie die Simulation eines neuronalen Netzes versuchen \u00b6 Quelle: \u00dcbersetzung von Pixees franz\u00f6sische Website Was ist ein neuronales Netzwerk und wie funktioniert es? Ein neuronales Netz ist ein allgemeiner Mechanismus, der aus kleinen Einheiten (Pseudoneuronen) besteht, die miteinander verbunden sind. Jede Einheit f\u00fchrt eine sehr einfache Operation durch: Sie nimmt Eingabewerte entgegen, kombiniert sie sehr einfach (eine einfache Mittelwertbildung mit Koeffizienten) und wendet eine Transformation auf das Ergebnis an (z. B. beh\u00e4lt sie nur positive Werte). Die Koeffizienten, die zur Gewichtung des Durchschnitts verwendet werden, sind die Parameter dieses Algorithmus. Erst die Kombination einer sehr, sehr gro\u00dfen Anzahl dieser Einheiten erm\u00f6glicht die Durchf\u00fchrung sehr komplexer Operationen. Ein Netz solcher \"Neuronen\" erh\u00e4lt man durch die Anh\u00e4ufung mehrerer Schichten solcher Einheiten. Die Eingabe sind die Daten, die wir verarbeiten wollen. Sie werden durch alle Schichten transformiert, und die letzte Schicht gibt als Ausgabe eine Vorhersage \u00fcber diese Daten ab, zum Beispiel um zu erkennen, ob ein Gesicht in einem Bild zu sehen ist. Das neuronale Netz ist also eine parametrisierte Funktion mit vielen Koeffizienten (den sogenannten \"Gewichten\"), und die Wahl dieser Gewichte bestimmt die durchgef\u00fchrte Verarbeitung. Wo sind die Neuronen in TensorFlow? Auf der TensorFlow-Weboberfl\u00e4che kann ein Netzwerk mit einem Dutzend Neuronen, jedes mit 3 bis 10 Parametern, leicht erstellt werden. Die berechnete Ausgabe h\u00e4ngt also von hunderten von Parametern zus\u00e4tzlich zu den beiden Koordinaten (x,y) des Eingabepunktes ab. Auf der Oberfl\u00e4che stellt jedes Quadrat ein Neuron dar, und die Farbe des Pixels mit den Koordinaten (x,y) im Quadrat entspricht der Ausgabe des Neurons, wenn wir (x,y) in den Eingang des Netzes geben. Wenn es nur ein Neuron am Ausgang gibt, wird es durch ein gr\u00f6\u00dferes Quadrat auf der rechten Seite des Netzes dargestellt. Die Parameter des Netzes werden mit Zufallswerten initialisiert. Aber wie lernt man diese Gewichte? Das \u00fcberwachte Lernen besteht darin, Datenbeispiele mit der zu findenden L\u00f6sung zu versehen, um das Netz zu trainieren, diese Gewichte nach Bedarf anzupassen. In dem Beispiel in der obigen Abbildung handelt es sich um eine Reihe von Punkten in einem Quadrat mit jeweils einer erwarteten Farbe (blau oder orange), mit dem Ziel, die Farbe des Punktes an einer bestimmten Stelle vorherzusagen. Ein klassischer Algorithmus zur schrittweisen Anpassung der Gewichte wird verwendet, um die fraglichen Parameter zu finden. \u00dcber die Schaltfl\u00e4che \"Play\" oben links auf der Benutzeroberfl\u00e4che wird dieser Algorithmus gestartet, und die Ausgabe des neuronalen Netzes entwickelt sich im Laufe des \"Lernprozesses\": Die Hintergrundfarbe des Ausgangsneurons nimmt die Farbe der Trainingspunkte an, die \u00fcber ihm gezeichnet werden. Ein anderer Teil des Datensatzes wird dann verwendet, um die Qualit\u00e4t der resultierenden Funktion des Netzes zu testen. Eine Kurve oben rechts zeigt die Fehlerrate der zum Lernen verwendeten Daten (um zu \u00fcberpr\u00fcfen, ob die Gewichte richtig angepasst wurden) und die Fehlerrate der anderen Testdaten (um zu \u00fcberpr\u00fcfen, ob das Gelernte gut auf neue Daten verallgemeinert werden kann). Mit den Schaltfl\u00e4chen auf der linken Seite k\u00f6nnen Sie die Verteilung der Daten zwischen dem Trainings- und dem Testdatensatz anpassen und auch Fehler zu den Daten hinzuf\u00fcgen (verrauschte Daten), um zu sehen, ob der Mechanismus gegen\u00fcber diesen Fehlern robust ist. In der Praxis gelingt es uns, zufriedenstellende Parameter zu finden, aber es gibt keinen wirklichen theoretischen Rahmen, um all dies zu formalisieren, es ist eine Frage des Experimentierens: die richtige Anzahl von Neuronen, die richtige Anzahl von Neuronenschichten, welche Vorberechnungen als Eingabe hinzugef\u00fcgt werden sollen (z. B. Multiplikation der Eingaben, um die Freiheitsgrade f\u00fcr die Berechnung zu erh\u00f6hen). Solche Techniken k\u00f6nnen in der Praxis zu beeindruckenden Ergebnissen f\u00fchren, z.

Type: text Description: Identifizieren Sie die verschiedenen Arten von Risiken Subject: Artificial Intelligence for and by Teachers Authors: AI4T Licence: CC BY 4.0 Date: 2022-11-15 Where Does the Risk Come From? \u00b6 In seiner Studie \u00fcber K\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz 1 stellt der Europ\u00e4ische Parlamentarische Forschungsdienst fest: \" Es ist wichtig, darauf hinzuweisen, dass KI-Algorithmen nicht objektiv sein k\u00f6nnen, da sie - genau wie Menschen - im Laufe ihrer Ausbildung eine Art und Weise entwickeln, wie sie das, was sie zuvor gesehen haben, einordnen, und diese 'Weltsicht' nutzen, um neue Situationen, mit denen sie konfrontiert werden, zu kategorisieren. \" [deepl translation] Schauen wir uns an, woher die Subjektivit\u00e4t einer KI kommt und welche Risiken damit verbunden sind. Die Verzerrung in Daten und Algorithmen \u00b6 Wie bei jedem digitalen System stammen die in KI-basierten Plattformen verwendeten Daten aus verschiedenen Quellen und haben unterschiedliche Formate. Sie weisen verschiedene Arten von Verzerrungen auf 2 . Datenverzerrungen sind haupts\u00e4chlich statistischer Natur. Lassen Sie uns ein paar davon auflisten. Stichprobenverzerrungen sind typischerweise in den Datenwerten vorhanden. Dies ist zum Beispiel der Fall, wenn ein Einstellungsalgorithmus, der auf einer Datenbank trainiert wurde, in der M\u00e4nner \u00fcberrepr\u00e4sentiert sind, Frauen ausschlie\u00dft. Stereotype Voreingenommenheit ist eine Tendenz, in Bezug auf die soziale Gruppe zu handeln, der wir angeh\u00f6ren. Eine Studie zeigt zum Beispiel, dass Frauen dazu neigen, auf Stellenangebote zu klicken, von denen sie glauben, dass sie als Frau leichter zu bekommen sind.

Subject: Artificial Intelligence for and by Teachers Authors: AI4T Licence: CC BY 4.0 Date: 2022-11-15 Entscheidungsfindung mit KI in Medizin und Justiz \u00b6 Wenn es um die Unterst\u00fctzung bei der Entscheidungsfindung geht, gibt es zwei Bereiche, in denen KI bereits seit langem eingesetzt wird: Recht und Medizin. In Anbetracht der Bedeutung der in diesen Bereichen getroffenen Entscheidungen sind sie interessante Beispiele, die man sich ansehen sollte. KI und Medizin \u00b6 \" KI steht in der Tat im Mittelpunkt der Medizin der Zukunft mit assistierten Operationen, Fern\u00fcberwachung von Patienten, intelligenten Prothesen oder sogar personalisierten Behandlungen dank der Vernetzung von Daten (Bigdata) .\" [deepl translation] 1 Vor etwa 50 Jahren wurde im Bereich der Diagnose eines der bekanntesten Expertensysteme entwickelt: MYCIN. \" Es war ein fr\u00fches Expertensystem, das k\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz nutzte, um Bakterien zu identifizieren, die schwere Infektionen wie Bakteri\u00e4mie und Meningitis verursachten, und um Antibiotika zu empfehlen, wobei die Dosierung an das K\u00f6rpergewicht des Patienten angepasst wurde \" [deepl translation] 2 . MYCIN wurde 1972 entwickelt und war 6 Jahre sp\u00e4ter in der Lage, die \u00c4rzte bei der Erstellung genauer Diagnosen zu \u00fcbertreffen. In einem gro\u00df angelegten Test wurden MYCIN und 9 \u00c4rzte, Praktikanten und Akademiker, gebeten, bei 80 Patienten mit Meningitis Diagnosen zu stellen und Rezepte auszustellen. Die Diagnosen und Verordnungen wurden dann von 8 Meningitis-Spezialisten und ... MYCIN schnitt besser ab als die menschlichen Experten. Ein wichtiger Bereich des maschinellen Lernens f\u00fcr medizinische Zwecke ist heute die Bildanalyse f\u00fcr medizinische Diagnosen 3 . Lassen Sie uns in wenigen Worten sehen, wie es funktioniert, wie Ga\u00ebl Varoquaux, AI Inria-Forscher, erkl\u00e4rt: \" Maschinelles Lernen ist ein Teilgebiet der K\u00fcnstlichen Intelligenz (KI). Kurz gesagt geht es darum, eine Software mit Tausenden von Beispielen zu f\u00fcttern, damit sie lernt, Erkennungsaufgaben auszuf\u00fchren, z. B. Bilder durchzusehen, um Hunde oder Katzen zu identifizieren. Sch\u00f6nheitsflecken oder b\u00f6sartige Melanome. Theoretisch sollte dies eine breite Palette von Anwendungen in der Medizin er\u00f6ffnen. So werden beispielsweise R\u00f6ntgenbilder von Tausenden von Patienten gesammelt, die an der gleichen Krankheit leiden - eine so genannte Kohorte. Anhand dieser Daten aus dem maschinellen Lernen kann der Computer dann dieselben visuellen Merkmale in allen neuen Bildern erkennen, die w\u00e4hrend des Screenings f\u00fcr andere Personen aufgenommen werden. Dies werden die Zieldaten .\" [deepl translation] 4 KI und Justiz \u00b6 Im Bereich der Justiz gibt es zwei Hauptanwendungsbereiche f\u00fcr KI-Systeme. Zum einen sind es Werkzeuge, die bei der Entscheidungsfindung helfen k\u00f6nnen. Ein KI-System kann einen Richter bei der Untersuchung eines Falles unterst\u00fctzen, indem es ihn beispielsweise \u00fcber alle Urteile informiert, die von einschl\u00e4gigen Gerichten in \u00e4hnlichen F\u00e4llen gef\u00e4llt wurden. In diesem Fall verbessert die KI die Informationssuche, aber die Entscheidung trifft der Richter selbst 5 . Dann gibt es Werkzeuge, die Entscheidungen vorhersagen k\u00f6nnen. In diesem Fall schl\u00e4gt die KI dem Richter direkt eine Gerichtsentscheidung vor 6 . Die Software analysiert eine gro\u00dfe Anzahl von Beispielen f\u00fcr Gerichtsentscheidungen und leitet daraus \"automatisch\" Entscheidungsregeln ab. Das Aufkommen der pr\u00e4diktiven Justiz wirft viele Fragen auf. Wenn \" die Anwendung von KI im Bereich der Justiz zur Verbesserung der Effizienz und Qualit\u00e4t \" beitragen kann, [muss sie] \" auf eine verantwortungsvolle Weise umgesetzt werden, die mit den Grundrechten \u00fcbereinstimmt \" [deepl translation] 7 . Auf europ\u00e4ischer Ebene wurde 2018 eine Ethik-Charta f\u00fcr den Einsatz k\u00fcnstlicher Intelligenz in Justizsystemen und deren Umfeld verabschiedet.

Particularly in view of their many implications for education. 1 - Understanding ChatGPT \u00b6 To give you a better idea of what these language models are, The AI4T team wante dto share with you the work of the Flowers team (Inria Centre at the University of Bordeaux) which carries out scientific research in the field of developmental artificial intelligence. In particular, it is interested in computer modelling of human learning mechanisms, and the role of curiosity and language in cognitive development. It is also studying the properties of the major language models (ChatGPT, Mistral, etc), and developing methods that will enable them to be better anchored in the real world. The team is also studying applications of this work in the field of educational technologies, as well as to help scientists (physicists, biologists, etc.) explore and better understand new systems (materials, self-organising chemical reactions, etc.). Episode#1: How do language models work? \u00b6 \u00ab How does ChatGPT work? An overview in less than 5 minutes \u00bb (in English) Synopsis: This video is an introduction to large language models which are the basis for tools like ChatGPT or Bard. They are intended for the general public (for instance students and professors in middle and high school, and more generally anyone not accustomed to computer science or AI). This is a 5-minute overview answering these questions: - How are these models \"trained\"? - On which type and amount of data are they trained, and what is the impact of the size of the training corpus? - Which types of tasks are they capable of doing, and how can we ask them to perform those tasks? - What are their main usages in society? - What are their limitations and biases? What social issues? - Which organizations develop these models? Are there \"open-sourced\" ones ?. It's aimed at a wide audience, including students and teachers in secondary schools. Episode#2: How to get a language model to perform a task? \u00b6 \u00ab Prompting, or the art of making yourself understood by ChatGPT: Explained in 5 minutes \u00bb (in English) Synopsis: Language Models, such as ChatGPT or Bard, have demonstrated impressive capabilities for a wide range of tasks. However, they also have numerous limitations and weaknesses! In this video, we explain the main ones: - Language Models are trained on data of varying quality and origin. The selection of this data is often not precisely controlled. - This data, and thus the Language Models, can contain \"biases\", meaning an automatic way of thinking that is not based on reasoning or facts. These biases can be unfair and reinforce stereotypes. If these biases are not controlled, they will be reflected in the output and usage of these models. ... Episode#3: Limits and weaknesses of language models \u00b6 \u00ab What are the limits of ChatGPT? Explained in 5 minutes \u00bb (in English) Synopsis: Language models such as ChatGPT or Bard have shown impressive capabilities for a wide variety of tasks. However, they also have many limitations and weaknesses! Episode#4: The strengths of language models \u00b6 \u00ab The strengths of language models \u00bb (in French - English version soon available) Synopsis: This video presents the main strengths of language models such as ChatGPT or Bard. Despite certain weaknesses, they also possess a large number of strengths, such as : - their ability to analyze a given context to provide an appropriate response to a task - their use of external tools (e.g. Wikipedia) - the wide range of data on which they have been trained - their ability to produce basic reasoning - their \"common sense\" in certain contexts - their ability to help us come up with creative ideas Episode#5 : advanced prompting and reasoning \u00b6 \u00ab Advanced prompting and reasoning \u00bb (in French - English version soon available) Synopsis : This video shows how language models such as ChatGPT or Bard are able to hold simple reasonings to solve a given problem. However, it is sometimes necessary to use various advanced prompts techniques to help them organise such reasoning. Some of these techniques (e.g. thought chains) are presented here; then the origin and limits of these reasoning abilities are discussed. Episode#6 : Language model applications \u00b6 \u00ab Language model applications \u00bb (in French) Synopsis : Language models such as ChatGPT or Bard are becoming increasingly powerful and are being used in more and more areas. In this video, we look at the possible applications of these tools in areas such as work, health, education and language preservation. Episode#7 : Language model and tools \u00b6 \u00ab Language model and tools \u00bb (in French) Synopsis : Language models such as ChatGPT or Gemini are capable of performing a wide variety of tasks to meet their user's needs. To make the most of their skills, they can be made to manipulate tools when writing their response. Licence and citation \u00b6 This video series has a Creative Commons CC-BY licence.

Enhancing Understanding with Easy-to-Read and Understand (FALC) \u00b6 Principle: FALC (in french Facile \u00e0 Lire et \u00e0 Comprendre, in english easy to read and understand ) simplifies vocabulary, syntax, and text formatting to make content accessible to students with reading or comprehension difficulties or cognitive disabilities. AI can automate this reformulation while preserving the educational meaning. Application example: A teacher can ask an AI to reformulate exercise instructions or project steps according to FALC principles, improving clarity and comprehension for all students. Diversifying Learning Materials \u00b6 Principle: AI enables the delivery of content in multiple formats according to learner needs and preferences: text, image, audio, or video. This approach supports attention, autonomy, and equal access to information. Application example: From a single lesson, an AI can generate an audio version for dyslexic students, a visual diagram for visual learners, or a simplified summary for students requiring comprehension support. Training and Supporting Teachers \u00b6 Principle: The effectiveness of AI for inclusion also depends on teacher training and approach. It can be used for self-training, adjusting communication, or redesigning course materials inclusively. AI can also facilitate clearer, more considerate communication. Application example: A teacher can use AI to reformulate a message for a student or family to make it more accessible, or to adapt an activity without disrupting group dynamics.

It can also be used more widely for collaborative editing and publishing of digital resources (websites, databases, course documents, etc.). A forge offers: online storage of files that can be synchronised with your own computer to ensure that the data is always available; version management tools to keep a history of changes; collaborative tools for correcting errors and suggesting new ideas; tools for creating web pages, publishing software online or transforming text files into complex documents (slideshows, diagrams, etc.). Although forges were mainly used by software developers, the teaching and training community can also benefit greatly from this type of platform. The forge of the Digital Education Commons created by Alexis Kauffmann is now promoted by the french Ministry of Education A solution that supports and facilitates multilinguism \u00b6 To co-design and distribute open educational resources, the Inria Learning Lab regularly uses Git forges. We had the opportunity to use this solution to create bilingual resources for the Mooc Environmental impact of digital technologies . For the AI4T project, we have then adapted our methodology to create a multilingual system . The Mooc is now available in 5 languages. How to Build Your Own Training, a 3-Step process \u00b6 Step 1 - Forking the Mooc: Create your own AI4T repository on GitHub Step 2 - Translating the Mooc ressources: A simple methodology to translate textes and contents & review the result. Step 3 - View & Share: Visualise your ressources on a static webpage & update the multilingual navigation. Then Let's go, Build your own training ! Please note that although we have tried to be as specific as possible in presenting the different stages in generating Mooc pages in a new language, it is recommended that a developer or someone who is comfortable with IT be involved in the technical part (fork of the repository, generation of text in the target language, updating of .py or .yml files, generation of the static webpages).

Here are two solutions we adopted within the project. Where no substitution is possible: maintenance of the original resource in english (as for example, documents as the AI Watch, JRC publications, aso.) Where an alternative resource exists, it can be listed alongside the original resource. In order to be as close as possible to the local context, the addition of references in the target languages is recommended. Reminder about translation quality /accuracy The translated text are generated by DeepL from one version of the Mooc (we recommand using the english version as a base for further translation). Adjustments to improve the quality of the translation may be required and first proofreading must be carried out; sometimes DeepL interprets signs (such as \"*\") incorrectly and there may be discrepancies in the translation (one or more elements of the text have remained in the source language). A first \"formal clean-up\" of the translation is therefore useful before moving on to the substantive proofreading.","title":"3.2.2 Step 2.2 - Proofreading Texts"},{"location":"de/3-Build-your-own-training/3-2-Step-2-Translating-the-mooc-resources/3-2-2-Step-2-2.html#where-to-find-the-texts-of-the-mooc-to-proofread-and-correct","text":"All texts, images and activities of the 4 Modules with Presentation and Conclusion Modules are available in the GitHub repository you have created in Step 2-1: \"Creating and translating texts\" ).

Sources and bibliographical references An important work is to be done in order to complement or replace ressources in English mentioned in the Mooc. Here are two solutions we adopted within the project. Where no substitution is possible: maintenance of the original resource in english (as for example, documents as the AI Watch, JRC publications, aso.) Where an alternative resource exists, it can be listed alongside the original resource. In order to be as close as possible to the local context, the addition of references in the target languages is recommended. Reminder about translation quality /accuracy The translated text are generated by DeepL from one version of the Mooc (we recommand using the english version as a base for further translation). Adjustments to improve the quality of the translation may be required and first proofreading must be carried out; sometimes DeepL interprets signs (such as \"*\") incorrectly and there may be discrepancies in the translation (one or more elements of the text have remained in the source language). A first \"formal clean-up\" of the translation is therefore useful before moving on to the substantive proofreading.","title":"What to check"},{"location":"de/3-Build-your-own-training/3-2-Step-2-Translating-the-mooc-resources/3-2-3-Step-2-3.html","text":"All videos of the Mooc are hosted on the YouTube channel of the project https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBd_PgP_BdhmgdSzz5d83vQ Videos are available in different languages \u00b6 Within the AI4T project lifespan, most of the Mooc's videos have been produced in the 5 languages of the partnership (ie : English, German, French, Italian & Slovenian) with different solutions depending on the nature / origin of the video.

Type: text Description: Dnevnik je bil v celoti povezan s podatki, ki so bili uporabljeni za analizo: V nadaljevanju se seznanite s tem, kaj so podatki in kako se uporabljajo v umetni inteligenci. Subject: Artificial Intelligence for and by Teachers Authors: AI4T Laurent Romary - Inria Licence: CC BY 4.0 Date: 2022-11-15 Kaj so podatki? \u00b6 Vloga podatkov v sistemu umetne inteligence \u00b6 V splo\u0161nem digitalnem smislu podatki ustrezajo informacijam, ki jih uporablja, obdeluje in ustvarja programska oprema v ra\u010dunalni\u0161kem sistemu. Brez podatkov ni umetne inteligence. Podatki imajo osrednjo vlogo v vseh procesih strojnega u\u010denja, saj se uporabljajo tako za usposabljanje kot za testiranje. Prihajajo tudi v obliki parametrov, ki se uporabljajo za upravljanje procesov usposabljanja. Kon\u010dno je sistem umetne inteligence kombinacija dolo\u010dene programske arhitekture z vsemi u\u010denimi parametri, tako imenovanim modelom, ki je prav tako podatek. Razumevanje vloge podatkov v sistemih umetne inteligence skupaj z na\u010dinom njihovega izbiranja, dokumentiranja in raz\u0161irjanja je bistvenega pomena za oceno obna\u0161anja sistema umetne inteligence. To je pomembno z vidika ponovljivosti ali za primerjavo dveh razli\u010dnih sistemov umetne inteligence. V svetu obdelave naravnega jezika je na primer razpolo\u017eljivost velikih koli\u010din govorjenih in pisanih podatkov klju\u010dnega pomena za delovanje programov za preverjanje \u010drkovanja, napovedovanje v iskalnikih ali seveda za strojno prevajanje. Uporabljajo se za izgradnjo tako imenovanih jezikovnih modelov, ki nadaljnjim postopkom zagotavljajo statisti\u010dne predstavitve kombinacij besed ali stavkov. Trajnost sistemov umetne inteligence je torej tesno odvisna od metod upravljanja podatkov, ki se uporabljajo pri njihovi zasnovi. Podatki za nadzorovane in nenadzorovane sisteme umetne inteligence \u00b6 Kot smo \u017ee videli, so sistemi umetne inteligence na voljo v dveh razli\u010dicah, odvisno od na\u010dina uporabe podatkov za njihovo usposabljanje. Nadzorovani sistemi se zana\u0161ajo na zagotavljanje vhodnih podatkov skupaj z ustreznimi predvidenimi izhodnimi podatki. Usposabljanje je torej sestavljeno iz u\u010denja sistema, da iz neznanih vhodov ustvari najverjetnej\u0161i izhod. Tak\u0161ne podatke je mogo\u010de pridobiti na razli\u010dne na\u010dine. Na primer slikovna zbirka podatkov, kjer je vsaka slika povezana s klju\u010dnimi besedami, ali zbirka digitaliziranih dokumentov, ki so jih prepisali anotatorji (glej spodnjo sliko). Slika: Slika 1: Samodejni prepis pisma Paula D'Estournellesa (z dovoljenjem F. Chiffoleauja, Coll. Archives de la Sarthe) Sistemi umetne inteligence, ki temeljijo na nenadzorovanem usposabljanju, ne bodo zasnovani za dolo\u010deno vedenje, temve\u010d bodo oblikovani tako, da bodo upo\u0161tevali statisti\u010dne lastnosti podatkov za usposabljanje. To velja na primer za jezikovne modele, kot je BERT, ki besedam z enakim skladenjskim ali pomenskim vedenjem obi\u010dajno pripi\u0161ejo podobne polo\u017eaje v matemati\u010dnem prostoru, kar se opazi na podlagi zagotavljanja velikega \u0161tevila vzor\u010dnih stavkov za vsako besedo. Tak\u0161ni modeli so na primer zelo dobri pri napovedovanju sinonimov ali nadaljnjih besed danega zaporedja. Viri - izbor, dokumentacija, priprava, anotacija \u00b6 Zasnova sistema umetne inteligence v bistvu temelji na ustrezni zasnovi nabora podatkov, ki se uporablja za njegovo usposabljanje. Med razli\u010dnimi dejavniki, ki pridejo v po\u0161tev, lahko navedemo ustreznost podatkov za obravnavano nalogo, velikost podatkov, ki mora ustrezati zapletenosti programske arhitekture umetne inteligence --- ve\u010d kot je matemati\u010dnih parametrov za usposabljanje, ve\u010d podatkov potrebujete --- in raznolikost vzorcev, ki mora odra\u017eati zapletenost naloge. Glede na vire podatkov je treba podatke izbrati in pogosto o\u010distiti, preden se vklju\u010dijo v postopek usposabljanja. \u010ce vzamemo na primer usposabljanje jezikovnega modela na podlagi spletne vsebine, je treba razli\u010dne vzorce razvrstiti glede na dejanski jezik, jih o\u010distiti spremljajo\u010de spletne kode (HTML, Javascript itd.) in po mo\u017enosti preme\u0161ati, da se prepre\u010dijo kr\u0161itve avtorskih pravic. Dober primer tak\u0161ne priprave podatkov je oblikovanje korpusa OSCAR 1 . Oblikovanje anotiranih podatkov za nadzorovane sisteme umetne inteligence je bolj zapleteno, saj vklju\u010duje oblikovanje sheme anotacije, organizacijo kampanj anotacije in nadzor kakovosti anotiranih podatkov, na primer z ocenjevanjem soglasja med anotatorji istih podatkov. Na splo\u0161no je bistveno, da je postopek na\u010drtovanja dobro dokumentiran, da bi lahko izsledili vir morebitnega neuspe\u0161nega obna\u0161anja v rezultatnem usposobljenem sistemu. pristranski sistemi umetne inteligence \u00b6 Kot smo \u017ee omenili, obna\u0161anje sistema umetne inteligence tesno odra\u017ea naravo podatkov, ki so bili uporabljeni za njegovo usposabljanje. To pa lahko povzro\u010di celo vrsto mo\u017enih pristranskosti, ki so lahko posledica osnovne izbire podatkovnih nizov. Tako bo na primer jezikovni model, ki je usposobljen samo na \u010dasopisnih \u010dlankih, zajemal popolnoma druga\u010dne vrste izrazov in tem kot model, za katerega je bila izbrana literatura ali vsebina dru\u017eabnih omre\u017eij. Na enak na\u010din bodo sistemi za generiranje slik odra\u017eali velikost in raznolikost podatkovnih zbirk izvornih slik (npr. umetni\u0161kih del), ki so bile upo\u0161tevane. Pri nadzorovanih sistemih lahko posebna pristranskost izhaja iz na\u010dina oblikovanja oznak za anotacijo in tudi iz na\u010dina, kako bodo anotatorji s svojim kulturnim ozadjem razlagali podatke. \u010ce \u017eelite na primer prepoznati sovra\u017eni govor v dru\u017eabnih omre\u017ejih, se lahko na\u010din, kako si anotatorji razlagajo \u010dustva, razlikuje glede na starost, kulturo in osebne ob\u010dutke anotatorjev v zvezi z gradivom, ki ga je treba anotirati. Na splo\u0161no je treba vedno upo\u0161tevati, da so sistemi umetne inteligence \u017ee po svoji zasnovi zelo konservativni glede svojih podatkov za u\u010denje in s tem glede obstoje\u010dih opazovanih podatkov. Od sistema umetne inteligence ne moremo pri\u010dakovati prave ustvarjalnosti. Gostovanje, zdru\u017eevanje in distribucija podatkov \u00b6 Zaradi velikosti in morebitne zapletenosti podatkov za u\u010denje v sistemih umetne inteligence ter iz njih izhajajo\u010dih modelov so bile vzpostavljene razli\u010dne pobude, ki omogo\u010dajo njihovo gostovanje in distribucijo. Odprte podatkovne nize in modele je mogo\u010de gostiti v specializiranih skladi\u0161\u010dih (npr. vir slikovnih podatkov 2 ) ali v splo\u0161nih nacionalnih ali mednarodnih (npr. Zenodo 3 ) skladi\u0161\u010dih. Tak\u0161ni repozitoriji obi\u010dajno zagotavljajo potrebno infrastrukturo za upravljanje avtorstva, licenciranja, verzioniranja in arhiviranja svoje vsebine. Pri kompleksnih nalogah, kjer razli\u010dne skupine vzporedno delajo na anotiranju razli\u010dnih podatkovnih vzorcev, nekatere pobude delujejo kot katalogi za ustrezne podatkovne vire. Tako je na primer v primeru pobude HTR United 4 , ki zbira metapodatke anotiranih dokumentov za prepoznavanje (rokopisnega) besedila.

Trajnost sistemov umetne inteligence je torej tesno odvisna od metod upravljanja podatkov, ki se uporabljajo pri njihovi zasnovi.","title":"Vloga podatkov v sistemu umetne inteligence"},{"location":"sl/1-Mooc/module-3-how-does-AI-work/3-2-lets-play-with-the-data/3-2-2-what-is-data.html#podatki-za-nadzorovane-in-nenadzorovane-sisteme-umetne-inteligence","text":"Kot smo \u017ee videli, so sistemi umetne inteligence na voljo v dveh razli\u010dicah, odvisno od na\u010dina uporabe podatkov za njihovo usposabljanje. Nadzorovani sistemi se zana\u0161ajo na zagotavljanje vhodnih podatkov skupaj z ustreznimi predvidenimi izhodnimi podatki. Usposabljanje je torej sestavljeno iz u\u010denja sistema, da iz neznanih vhodov ustvari najverjetnej\u0161i izhod. Tak\u0161ne podatke je mogo\u010de pridobiti na razli\u010dne na\u010dine. Na primer slikovna zbirka podatkov, kjer je vsaka slika povezana s klju\u010dnimi besedami, ali zbirka digitaliziranih dokumentov, ki so jih prepisali anotatorji (glej spodnjo sliko). Slika: Slika 1: Samodejni prepis pisma Paula D'Estournellesa (z dovoljenjem F. Chiffoleauja, Coll. Archives de la Sarthe) Sistemi umetne inteligence, ki temeljijo na nenadzorovanem usposabljanju, ne bodo zasnovani za dolo\u010deno vedenje, temve\u010d bodo oblikovani tako, da bodo upo\u0161tevali statisti\u010dne lastnosti podatkov za usposabljanje. To velja na primer za jezikovne modele, kot je BERT, ki besedam z enakim skladenjskim ali pomenskim vedenjem obi\u010dajno pripi\u0161ejo podobne polo\u017eaje v matemati\u010dnem prostoru, kar se opazi na podlagi zagotavljanja velikega \u0161tevila vzor\u010dnih stavkov za vsako besedo.

Pri vrsti problema \"razvr\u0161\u010danje\" je cilj lo\u010diti modro in oran\u017eno obarvane to\u010dke. Uporaba te vrste problema je na primer algoritem za razvr\u0161\u010danje fotografij. V spodnjem primeru je en vhodni podatek (zna\u010dilnost), ki lo\u010duje to\u010dke vodoravno, in drugi, ki lo\u010duje navpi\u010dno. Z zdru\u017eitvijo teh dveh vhodov dobimo po\u0161evno lo\u010devanje. Rezultat (izhod) je dobro prilagojen izbrani vrsti podatkov. Pogled na igri\u0161\u010de tenzorskega toka TensorFlow: nekaj pojasnil, preden poskusite simulacijo nevronske mre\u017ee \u00b6 Izvir: prevod iz Pixejeve francoske spletne strani Ko je nevronsko omre\u017eje in kako deluje? Nevronsko omre\u017eje je splo\u0161ni mehanizem, sestavljen iz majhnih enot (psevdonevronov), ki so med seboj povezane. Vsaka enota izvaja zelo preprosto operacijo: sprejme vhodne vrednosti, jih zelo preprosto zdru\u017ei (preprosto povpre\u010denje s koeficienti) in na rezultat uporabi transformacijo (npr. ohrani samo pozitivne vrednosti). Parametri tega algoritma so koeficienti, ki se uporabljajo za ponderiranje povpre\u010dja. Kombinacija zelo, zelo velikega \u0161tevila teh enot je tista, ki omogo\u010da izvajanje zelo zapletenih operacij. Omre\u017eje tak\u0161nih \"nevronov\" dobimo z akumulacijo ve\u010d slojev tak\u0161nih enot. Vhod so podatki, ki jih \u017eelimo obdelati. Ti se preoblikujejo skozi vse plasti, zadnja plast pa kot rezultat poda napoved teh podatkov, na primer za ugotavljanje, ali je na sliki obraz. Nevronska mre\u017ea je torej parametrizirana funkcija s \u0161tevilnimi koeficienti (imenovanimi \"ute\u017ei\"), izbira teh ute\u017ei pa dolo\u010da izvedeno obdelavo. Kje so nevroni v programu TensorFlow? V spletnem vmesniku TensorFlow lahko preprosto ustvarite omre\u017eje z ducatom nevronov, od katerih ima vsak od 3 do 10 parametrov. Izra\u010dunani rezultat je tako poleg dveh koordinat (x,y) vhodne to\u010dke odvisen od ve\u010d sto parametrov. Na vmesniku vsak kvadratek predstavlja nevron, barva pike s koordinatama (x,y) v kvadratku pa predstavlja izhod nevrona, ko vnesemo (x,y) v vhod omre\u017eja. \u010ce je na izhodu samo en nevron, je predstavljen z ve\u010djim kvadratom na desni strani omre\u017eja. Parametri omre\u017eja so inicializirani z naklju\u010dnimi vrednostmi. Ale kako se nau\u010dimo teh ute\u017ei? Nadzorno u\u010denje je sestavljeno iz zagotavljanja primerov podatkov z re\u0161itvijo, ki jo je treba poiskati, da se omre\u017eje usposobi za ustrezno prilagajanje teh ute\u017ei. V primeru na zgornji sliki gre za vrsto to\u010dk v kvadratu, od katerih ima vsaka pri\u010dakovano barvo (modro ali oran\u017eno), z namenom napovedati barvo to\u010dke na dolo\u010denem mestu.

Nevronsko omre\u017eje je splo\u0161ni mehanizem, sestavljen iz majhnih enot (psevdonevronov), ki so med seboj povezane. Vsaka enota izvaja zelo preprosto operacijo: sprejme vhodne vrednosti, jih zelo preprosto zdru\u017ei (preprosto povpre\u010denje s koeficienti) in na rezultat uporabi transformacijo (npr. ohrani samo pozitivne vrednosti). Parametri tega algoritma so koeficienti, ki se uporabljajo za ponderiranje povpre\u010dja. Kombinacija zelo, zelo velikega \u0161tevila teh enot je tista, ki omogo\u010da izvajanje zelo zapletenih operacij. Omre\u017eje tak\u0161nih \"nevronov\" dobimo z akumulacijo ve\u010d slojev tak\u0161nih enot. Vhod so podatki, ki jih \u017eelimo obdelati. Ti se preoblikujejo skozi vse plasti, zadnja plast pa kot rezultat poda napoved teh podatkov, na primer za ugotavljanje, ali je na sliki obraz. Nevronska mre\u017ea je torej parametrizirana funkcija s \u0161tevilnimi koeficienti (imenovanimi \"ute\u017ei\"), izbira teh ute\u017ei pa dolo\u010da izvedeno obdelavo. Kje so nevroni v programu TensorFlow? V spletnem vmesniku TensorFlow lahko preprosto ustvarite omre\u017eje z ducatom nevronov, od katerih ima vsak od 3 do 10 parametrov. Izra\u010dunani rezultat je tako poleg dveh koordinat (x,y) vhodne to\u010dke odvisen od ve\u010d sto parametrov. Na vmesniku vsak kvadratek predstavlja nevron, barva pike s koordinatama (x,y) v kvadratku pa predstavlja izhod nevrona, ko vnesemo (x,y) v vhod omre\u017eja. \u010ce je na izhodu samo en nevron, je predstavljen z ve\u010djim kvadratom na desni strani omre\u017eja. Parametri omre\u017eja so inicializirani z naklju\u010dnimi vrednostmi. Ale kako se nau\u010dimo teh ute\u017ei? Nadzorno u\u010denje je sestavljeno iz zagotavljanja primerov podatkov z re\u0161itvijo, ki jo je treba poiskati, da se omre\u017eje usposobi za ustrezno prilagajanje teh ute\u017ei. V primeru na zgornji sliki gre za vrsto to\u010dk v kvadratu, od katerih ima vsaka pri\u010dakovano barvo (modro ali oran\u017eno), z namenom napovedati barvo to\u010dke na dolo\u010denem mestu.

Predsodki v podatkih in algoritmih \u00b6 Tako kot pri vsakem digitalnem sistemu tudi podatki, ki se uporabljajo v platformah, ki temeljijo na umetni inteligenci, prihajajo iz razli\u010dnih virov in imajo ve\u010d oblik. V njih so prisotne razli\u010dne vrste pristranskosti 2 . Predsodki v podatkih so ve\u010dinoma statisti\u010dni. Na\u0161tejmo nekaj izmed njih. Za vzor\u010dno pristranskost je zna\u010dilno, da je prisotna v vrednostih podatkov. To na primer velja za algoritem za zaposlovanje, ki je usposobljen na podatkovni zbirki, v kateri so mo\u0161ki nadpovpre\u010dno zastopani, in bo izklju\u010dil \u017eenske. Stereotipna pristranskost je nagnjenost k delovanju glede na dru\u017ebeno skupino, ki ji pripadamo. Ena od \u0161tudij na primer ka\u017ee, da \u017eenske ponavadi kliknejo na ponudbe za delo, za katere menijo, da jih bodo kot \u017eenske la\u017eje dobile. Priznana pristranskost spremenljivke (pristranskost pri modeliranju ali kodiranju) je pristranskost zaradi te\u017eav pri predstavljanju ali kodiranju dejavnika v podatkih. Ker je na primer te\u017eko najti dejanska merila za merjenje \u010dustvene inteligence, ta razse\u017enost ni vklju\u010dena v algoritme zaposlovanja. Izbirna pristranskost pa je posledica zna\u010dilnosti vzorca, izbranega za oblikovanje zaklju\u010dkov.

Orodje umetne inteligence, namenjeno pou\u010devanju tujih jezikov, lahko na primer pomaga predlagati prave vaje ob pravem \u010dasu. O nalogi, ki bo verjetno najbolj pomembna za naslednjo stopnjo u\u010denja, se orodje AI odlo\u010di s kombinacijo \"krivulje pozabljanja\" Hermanna Ebbinghausa in u\u010den\u010devega modela (pridobljenega s spremljanjem statistike vsake \u017ee nau\u010dene besede). Tako na primer deluje Duolingo za \u0161ole . Da bi bolje razumeli, kako lahko umetna inteligenca spremeni na\u010din sprejemanja odlo\u010ditev, si je treba zapomniti, da obstajajo tri glavne stopnje vklju\u010denosti umetne inteligence v sprejemanje odlo\u010ditev 1 : Pri avtomatizaciji odlo\u010danja sistem sprejme odlo\u010ditev z uporabo preskriptivne analitike ali napovedne analitike. Njene prednosti vklju\u010dujejo hitrost, raz\u0161irljivost in doslednost sprejemanja odlo\u010ditev. Pri pove\u010danju odlo\u010danja sistem priporo\u010da odlo\u010ditev ali ve\u010d alternativnih odlo\u010ditev \u010dlove\u0161kim akterjem z uporabo preskriptivne ali napovedne analitike. Njegove prednosti so v sinergiji med \u010dlove\u0161kim znanjem in zmo\u017enostjo umetne inteligence, da hitro analizira velike koli\u010dine podatkov in se spopada s kompleksnostjo. Pri podpori pri odlo\u010danju \u010dlovek sprejme odlo\u010ditev , pri \u010demer ga podpira opisna, diagnosti\u010dna ali napovedna analitika. Njena glavna prednost je v kombinirani uporabi vpogledov, ki temeljijo na podatkih, in \u010dlove\u0161kega znanja, strokovnega znanja in zdrave pameti, vklju\u010dno s \"slutnjo\" in \u010dustvi. Vsaka stopnja pa lahko pokriva zelo razli\u010dne stvarnosti. Na primer, avtomatizacija odlo\u010danja se lahko uporablja za najrazli\u010dnej\u0161e namene.

Orodje umetne inteligence, namenjeno pou\u010devanju tujih jezikov, lahko na primer pomaga predlagati prave vaje ob pravem \u010dasu. O nalogi, ki bo verjetno najbolj pomembna za naslednjo stopnjo u\u010denja, se orodje AI odlo\u010di s kombinacijo \"krivulje pozabljanja\" Hermanna Ebbinghausa in u\u010den\u010devega modela (pridobljenega s spremljanjem statistike vsake \u017ee nau\u010dene besede). Tako na primer deluje Duolingo za \u0161ole . Da bi bolje razumeli, kako lahko umetna inteligenca spremeni na\u010din sprejemanja odlo\u010ditev, si je treba zapomniti, da obstajajo tri glavne stopnje vklju\u010denosti umetne inteligence v sprejemanje odlo\u010ditev 1 : Pri avtomatizaciji odlo\u010danja sistem sprejme odlo\u010ditev z uporabo preskriptivne analitike ali napovedne analitike. Njene prednosti vklju\u010dujejo hitrost, raz\u0161irljivost in doslednost sprejemanja odlo\u010ditev. Pri pove\u010danju odlo\u010danja sistem priporo\u010da odlo\u010ditev ali ve\u010d alternativnih odlo\u010ditev \u010dlove\u0161kim akterjem z uporabo preskriptivne ali napovedne analitike. Njegove prednosti so v sinergiji med \u010dlove\u0161kim znanjem in zmo\u017enostjo umetne inteligence, da hitro analizira velike koli\u010dine podatkov in se spopada s kompleksnostjo. Pri podpori pri odlo\u010danju \u010dlovek sprejme odlo\u010ditev , pri \u010demer ga podpira opisna, diagnosti\u010dna ali napovedna analitika. Njena glavna prednost je v kombinirani uporabi vpogledov, ki temeljijo na podatkih, in \u010dlove\u0161kega znanja, strokovnega znanja in zdrave pameti, vklju\u010dno s \"slutnjo\" in \u010dustvi. Vsaka stopnja pa lahko pokriva zelo razli\u010dne stvarnosti. Na primer, avtomatizacija odlo\u010danja se lahko uporablja za najrazli\u010dnej\u0161e namene.

To zahtevo je bolj ali manj enostavno izpolniti, vendar pri nekaterih tehnologijah umetne inteligence pojasnjevanja ni tako preprosto zagotoviti.

Particularly in view of their many implications for education. 1 - Understanding ChatGPT \u00b6 To give you a better idea of what these language models are, The AI4T team wante dto share with you the work of the Flowers team (Inria Centre at the University of Bordeaux) which carries out scientific research in the field of developmental artificial intelligence. In particular, it is interested in computer modelling of human learning mechanisms, and the role of curiosity and language in cognitive development. It is also studying the properties of the major language models (ChatGPT, Mistral, etc), and developing methods that will enable them to be better anchored in the real world. The team is also studying applications of this work in the field of educational technologies, as well as to help scientists (physicists, biologists, etc.) explore and better understand new systems (materials, self-organising chemical reactions, etc.). Episode#1: How do language models work? \u00b6 \u00ab How does ChatGPT work? An overview in less than 5 minutes \u00bb (in English) Synopsis: This video is an introduction to large language models which are the basis for tools like ChatGPT or Bard. They are intended for the general public (for instance students and professors in middle and high school, and more generally anyone not accustomed to computer science or AI). This is a 5-minute overview answering these questions: - How are these models \"trained\"? - On which type and amount of data are they trained, and what is the impact of the size of the training corpus? - Which types of tasks are they capable of doing, and how can we ask them to perform those tasks? - What are their main usages in society? - What are their limitations and biases? What social issues? - Which organizations develop these models? Are there \"open-sourced\" ones ?. It's aimed at a wide audience, including students and teachers in secondary schools. Episode#2: How to get a language model to perform a task? \u00b6 \u00ab Prompting, or the art of making yourself understood by ChatGPT: Explained in 5 minutes \u00bb (in English) Synopsis: Language Models, such as ChatGPT or Bard, have demonstrated impressive capabilities for a wide range of tasks. However, they also have numerous limitations and weaknesses! In this video, we explain the main ones: - Language Models are trained on data of varying quality and origin. The selection of this data is often not precisely controlled. - This data, and thus the Language Models, can contain \"biases\", meaning an automatic way of thinking that is not based on reasoning or facts. These biases can be unfair and reinforce stereotypes. If these biases are not controlled, they will be reflected in the output and usage of these models. ... Episode#3: Limits and weaknesses of language models \u00b6 \u00ab What are the limits of ChatGPT? Explained in 5 minutes \u00bb (in English) Synopsis: Language models such as ChatGPT or Bard have shown impressive capabilities for a wide variety of tasks. However, they also have many limitations and weaknesses! Episode#4: The strengths of language models \u00b6 \u00ab The strengths of language models \u00bb (in French - English version soon available) Synopsis: This video presents the main strengths of language models such as ChatGPT or Bard. Despite certain weaknesses, they also possess a large number of strengths, such as : - their ability to analyze a given context to provide an appropriate response to a task - their use of external tools (e.g. Wikipedia) - the wide range of data on which they have been trained - their ability to produce basic reasoning - their \"common sense\" in certain contexts - their ability to help us come up with creative ideas Episode#5 : advanced prompting and reasoning \u00b6 \u00ab Advanced prompting and reasoning \u00bb (in French - English version soon available) Synopsis : This video shows how language models such as ChatGPT or Bard are able to hold simple reasonings to solve a given problem. However, it is sometimes necessary to use various advanced prompts techniques to help them organise such reasoning. Some of these techniques (e.g. thought chains) are presented here; then the origin and limits of these reasoning abilities are discussed. Episode#6 : Language model applications \u00b6 \u00ab Language model applications \u00bb (in French) Synopsis : Language models such as ChatGPT or Bard are becoming increasingly powerful and are being used in more and more areas. In this video, we look at the possible applications of these tools in areas such as work, health, education and language preservation. Episode#7 : Language model and tools \u00b6 \u00ab Language model and tools \u00bb (in French) Synopsis : Language models such as ChatGPT or Gemini are capable of performing a wide variety of tasks to meet their user's needs. To make the most of their skills, they can be made to manipulate tools when writing their response. Licence and citation \u00b6 This video series has a Creative Commons CC-BY licence.

AI: Promises and limits by Nicolas ROUGIER \u00b6 Nicolas ROUGIER is Director of Research in Computational Cognitive Neuroscience at Inria (Mnemosyne team) - Member of the AI4T Mooc teaching team. He spoke on the subject of generative AI: promises and limits: \u2018The generative AI we have seen in action over the last few years have been improving steadily from generation to generation, promising us that we will soon see real revolutions in the workplace, and even intelligent AI in the general sense. And yet, as with autonomous vehicles, there are many reasons why we are still waiting for widespread production, and general AI seems to be out of reach. In this talk, I will review some of the likely causes and hard limits of generative AI\". Generative AI - some pedagogical experiences by Guillaume VINIACOURT and Franck BODIN \u00b6 Guillaume VINIACOURT and Frank BODIN are the national coordinators of the \u2018Digital Humanities & Education\u2019 thematic group of the Canop\u00e9 network. They spoke on the theme: IAs g\u00e9n\u00e9ratives, quelques exp\u00e9riences p\u00e9dagogiques. The domestication of generative AIs by pupils and their teachers has enabled the latter to engage in creative and educational experimentation. Between trial and error and discoveries, these new classroom interactions suggest an evolution in the skills to be developed.

Enhancing Understanding with Easy-to-Read and Understand (FALC) \u00b6 Principle: FALC (in french Facile \u00e0 Lire et \u00e0 Comprendre, in english easy to read and understand ) simplifies vocabulary, syntax, and text formatting to make content accessible to students with reading or comprehension difficulties or cognitive disabilities. AI can automate this reformulation while preserving the educational meaning. Application example: A teacher can ask an AI to reformulate exercise instructions or project steps according to FALC principles, improving clarity and comprehension for all students. Diversifying Learning Materials \u00b6 Principle: AI enables the delivery of content in multiple formats according to learner needs and preferences: text, image, audio, or video. This approach supports attention, autonomy, and equal access to information. Application example: From a single lesson, an AI can generate an audio version for dyslexic students, a visual diagram for visual learners, or a simplified summary for students requiring comprehension support. Training and Supporting Teachers \u00b6 Principle: The effectiveness of AI for inclusion also depends on teacher training and approach. It can be used for self-training, adjusting communication, or redesigning course materials inclusively. AI can also facilitate clearer, more considerate communication. Application example: A teacher can use AI to reformulate a message for a student or family to make it more accessible, or to adapt an activity without disrupting group dynamics.

Here are two solutions we adopted within the project. Where no substitution is possible: maintenance of the original resource in english (as for example, documents as the AI Watch, JRC publications, aso.) Where an alternative resource exists, it can be listed alongside the original resource. In order to be as close as possible to the local context, the addition of references in the target languages is recommended. Reminder about translation quality /accuracy The translated text are generated by DeepL from one version of the Mooc (we recommand using the english version as a base for further translation).
