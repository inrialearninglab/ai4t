00:00:00.606 --> 00:00:01.646 
The hotline.

00:00:01.686 --> 00:00:04.286 
Guillaume, what brings you here today?

00:00:04.326 --> 00:00:07.486 
My cousin Theo told me
that artificial intelligence

00:00:07.526 --> 00:00:08.886 
could replace us at work.

00:00:08.926 --> 00:00:10.086 
Maybe for him,

00:00:10.126 --> 00:00:13.166 
but I don't see how
AI could replace me in the office.

00:00:13.206 --> 00:00:15.526 
Unless it has a lot of good jokes.

00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:20.446 
Are humans worth scrapping?

00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:24.286 
I've been looking into this
and some studies

00:00:24.326 --> 00:00:27.286 
suggest that it will affect one
in two jobs in the next 10 to 20 years.

00:00:27.326 --> 00:00:30.326 
Yes, other studies talk about 15%.

00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:31.846 
It's a tricky topic.

00:00:31.886 --> 00:00:34.886 
The same question arose
during the industrial revolution,

00:00:34.926 --> 00:00:39.686 
when machines replaced 90%
of jobs in agriculture.

00:00:39.726 --> 00:00:41.686 
Still, nobody today would want

00:00:41.726 --> 00:00:43.886 
to go back to scythes or, for that matter,

00:00:43.926 --> 00:00:46.006 
part with their washing machine.

00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:47.926 
This is the story of innovation.

00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:50.046 
Yes, of course, but this is different.

00:00:50.086 --> 00:00:52.326 
Today, when we talk about computers,

00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:54.526 
we mean automatic information processing.

00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:57.806 
It's not about replacing workers.
It's about replacing intellectual work.

00:00:57.846 --> 00:01:01.886 
The advent of artificial intelligence
means that all our abilities

00:01:01.926 --> 00:01:03.726 
and ourselves will eventually be replaced.

00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:04.886 
Holiday for everyone!

00:01:04.926 --> 00:01:08.166 
Most jobs are not disappearing,
but being reinvented.

00:01:08.206 --> 00:01:11.446 
As Gregory Verdugo,
an economist and researcher, said,

00:01:11.486 --> 00:01:15.726 
"It's hard to predict
what will be technically automatable."

00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:17.366 
You're missing the point here.

00:01:17.406 --> 00:01:20.286 
No, I'm not.
I'm just saying that I'm not a medium.

00:01:20.326 --> 00:01:23.166 
I don't know
if my job will ever be fully automated.

00:01:23.206 --> 00:01:26.526 
But I do know
that I don't want to live in a society

00:01:26.566 --> 00:01:30.126 
that lets artificial intelligence
make a decision for me.

00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:33.606 
What do you want? What do you think?

00:01:33.646 --> 00:01:36.966 
Before I answer you,
I want to know a little more.

00:01:37.006 --> 00:01:38.046 
OK.

00:01:39.726 --> 00:01:42.886 
I'll conduct my own investigation
to make up my own mind.
