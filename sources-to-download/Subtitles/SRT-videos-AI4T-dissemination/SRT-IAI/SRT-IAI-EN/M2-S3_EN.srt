00:00:10.286 --> 00:00:12.406 
Machine learning and data.

00:00:14.246 --> 00:00:17.286 
When we talk
about artificial intelligence today,

00:00:17.326 --> 00:00:20.126 
we most often hear "machine learning".

00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:21.806 

00:00:21.886 --> 00:00:23.566 
There are two ways to learn.

00:00:23.606 --> 00:00:26.446 
The one that comes from the knowledge
that is passed on to us

00:00:26.486 --> 00:00:29.206 
is the symbolic approach,
and the one that comes from experience

00:00:29.246 --> 00:00:31.846 
that we acquire is the digital approach.

00:00:32.126 --> 00:00:37.366 
Machine learning is based on
the digital approach, i.e., experience.

00:00:37.446 --> 00:00:40.886 
The principle is not telling
the computer exactly what to do.

00:00:40.926 --> 00:00:44.246 
No, we'll program it
to learn from examples

00:00:44.286 --> 00:00:46.366 
based on statistical approaches.

00:00:47.646 --> 00:00:48.966 
Learning to learn.

00:00:50.846 --> 00:00:52.806 
I'll use the example of David Louapre,

00:00:53.046 --> 00:00:55.526 
researcher and science populariser,
to explain.

00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:57.206 
Let's say you are a botanist.

00:00:57.246 --> 00:00:58.366 
You are walking in the forest.

00:00:58.446 --> 00:00:59.846 
You make some observations.

00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:02.726 
You measure the height
and diameter of the trees

00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:04.606 
and record it all in a data table.

00:01:04.686 --> 00:01:06.166 
Once you get home,

00:01:06.246 --> 00:01:09.126 
you draw a graph
with the diameter on the x-axis

00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:12.726 
and the height on the y-axis,
and place your data on it.

00:01:12.766 --> 00:01:17.406 
You quickly you realise that the two
are linked and that by drawing,

00:01:17.446 --> 00:01:19.886 
in this case,
a straight line through the points,

00:01:19.926 --> 00:01:23.046 
this will allow you to
predict the height of a tree

00:01:23.086 --> 00:01:24.686 
from its diameter.

00:01:24.966 --> 00:01:27.126 
Machine learning works the same way.

00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:29.406 
You provide the calculation
with input data,

00:01:29.446 --> 00:01:30.726 
and output data.

00:01:30.766 --> 00:01:34.886 
You train it to find the relationship
between the two, the straight line,

00:01:35.086 --> 00:01:37.286 
by adjusting the parameters
of the calculation.

00:01:37.326 --> 00:01:39.606 
This is what we call generalisation.

00:01:40.526 --> 00:01:42.646 
Once this learning phase is done,

00:01:42.926 --> 00:01:46.446 
we can make predictions.
That means producing a correct answer

00:01:46.486 --> 00:01:49.926 
for similar data,
that the program wasn't trained on.

00:01:51.126 --> 00:01:53.406 
That's what machine learning is all about.

00:01:53.446 --> 00:01:55.446 
To be able to make predictions.

00:01:55.646 --> 00:01:58.126 
Predictions
that are not necessarily predictable.

00:01:58.366 --> 00:02:00.206 
How do these machines learn?

00:02:00.646 --> 00:02:02.966 
In fact,
there are several learning techniques.

00:02:03.486 --> 00:02:05.126 
We'll just talk about the two main ones.

00:02:05.446 --> 00:02:09.086 
Supervised learning is the example
of the botanist that we just saw.

00:02:09.286 --> 00:02:10.766 
First, there is a training phase

00:02:10.806 --> 00:02:13.886 
where data labelled
by humans feed the algorithm.

00:02:13.926 --> 00:02:15.686 
That's why it's called "supervised".

00:02:18.646 --> 00:02:20.086 
CAT

00:02:22.126 --> 00:02:24.646 
Then, there's a prediction phase
where the algorithm

00:02:24.686 --> 00:02:27.486 
will give an answer
for data that it has never seen.

00:02:28.766 --> 00:02:31.886 
98% CAT

00:02:31.926 --> 00:02:33.726 
This is used to extrapolate value,

00:02:33.766 --> 00:02:36.966 
but it's also used to differentiate
cats from dogs, for example.

00:02:38.526 --> 00:02:40.806 
2% CAT

00:02:41.446 --> 00:02:43.766 
Then, there is reinforcement learning

00:02:44.046 --> 00:02:47.246 
where the algorithm learns
by being immersed in an environment,

00:02:47.286 --> 00:02:50.566 
and where it will adjust its parameters
depending on the positive

00:02:50.606 --> 00:02:52.926 
or negative reaction
that follows each of its actions.

00:02:52.966 --> 00:02:55.886 
A bit like a child learning to ride a bike

00:02:55.926 --> 00:02:58.406 
who falls and gets up again,

00:02:58.446 --> 00:03:01.086 
This algorithm is mainly used for robots

00:03:01.126 --> 00:03:03.566 
or autonomous agents
and also works very well

00:03:03.606 --> 00:03:06.406 
in virtual worlds
or in specific situations.

00:03:08.286 --> 00:03:10.926 
Perfect for the game of Go,
but not so good for autonomous driving.

00:03:11.006 --> 00:03:14.166 
Imagine if a car had to crash
thousands of times

00:03:14.526 --> 00:03:16.406 
before a machine learns to drive it.

00:03:17.326 --> 00:03:18.606 
Every app has its own algorithm.

00:03:18.646 --> 00:03:20.806 
I've heard of deep learning.

00:03:20.846 --> 00:03:22.006 
What is it exactly?

00:03:22.286 --> 00:03:24.006 
Neural networks.

00:03:25.126 --> 00:03:28.126 
Deep learning is a machine learning method

00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:30.446 
which is based
on artificial neural networks.

00:03:30.526 --> 00:03:33.126 
Artificial neural networks
offer a calculation method

00:03:33.166 --> 00:03:34.846 
which is inspired by the brain.

00:03:35.686 --> 00:03:38.886 
Biological neurons are cells
connected to each other.

00:03:38.926 --> 00:03:41.926 
Simply put,
when a neuron receives a signal,

00:03:41.966 --> 00:03:45.766 
it can either send nothing,
or send its own signal.

00:03:47.246 --> 00:03:50.046 
Artificial neurons
are mathematical constructs

00:03:50.086 --> 00:03:53.206 
that roughly mimic how real neurons work.

00:03:54.086 --> 00:03:57.686 
Each neuron combines its inputs
and provides an output.

00:03:58.886 --> 00:04:02.046 
To make complicated functions,
you can combine many neurons.

00:04:02.086 --> 00:04:04.766 
That's what we call
an artificial neural network.

00:04:06.006 --> 00:04:07.406 
This method is not new.

00:04:07.446 --> 00:04:08.966 
In fact, it dates back to the 1950s,

00:04:09.046 --> 00:04:12.726 
but it requires
considerable computing power and data.

00:04:12.806 --> 00:04:16.206 
In the mid-2000s,
with the increase in processor capacity

00:04:16.246 --> 00:04:19.926 
and the mass of data
made available by the Internet,

00:04:20.446 --> 00:04:22.526 
everything changed
and we could move to the deep phase.

00:04:23.006 --> 00:04:25.326 
The neurons are arranged
in successive layers.

00:04:26.646 --> 00:04:28.806 
The results of the first layer of neurons

00:04:28.846 --> 00:04:30.726 
will be used as an input
to the calculations of the others,

00:04:31.846 --> 00:04:32.886 
and so on.

00:04:36.166 --> 00:04:38.286 
The more layers there are,
the deeper the network.

00:04:38.486 --> 00:04:41.646 
That's why learning
by deep neural networks

00:04:41.686 --> 00:04:43.166 
is called deep learning.

00:04:43.766 --> 00:04:45.966 
Let's take an example
on image recognition.

00:04:46.246 --> 00:04:48.806 
How is the neural network
able to learn on its own

00:04:48.846 --> 00:04:51.926 
how to recognise a picture of a cat,
when all it sees are pixels?

00:04:52.286 --> 00:04:54.646 
From the thousands of cat photos
that it was exposed to,

00:04:54.686 --> 00:04:58.326 
labelled as a cat,
it will be able to adjust the parameters

00:04:58.366 --> 00:05:01.126 
of its calculation
to extract characteristics

00:05:01.166 --> 00:05:03.686 
that determine what a cat is.

00:05:06.086 --> 00:05:09.206 
Once the programme has acquired
the notion of what a cat is,

00:05:09.246 --> 00:05:12.446 
it can make a prediction on a new image.

00:05:13.926 --> 00:05:17.246 
Sure, at the beginning,
the network will get a lot wrong,

00:05:17.286 --> 00:05:18.286 
lots of mistakes,

00:05:18.326 --> 00:05:20.446 
but the model will be built by adjustment,

00:05:20.526 --> 00:05:22.926 
by little successive changes.

00:05:22.966 --> 00:05:26.246 
By comparing these results
and adjusting its calculation,

00:05:26.286 --> 00:05:30.926 
it can identify a cat in a picture
that it's never seen before.

00:05:31.446 --> 00:05:33.686 
Exactly! It's about statistics.

00:05:33.726 --> 00:05:35.286 
As Marc Schoenauer explains,

00:05:35.326 --> 00:05:38.526 
research director at Inria,
"It's not about programming one thing

00:05:38.566 --> 00:05:41.006 
to get an exact result,

00:05:41.046 --> 00:05:45.366 
but rather to find patterns,
even if inaccurate, from data."

00:05:45.446 --> 00:05:47.206 
Hence, the importance of data.

00:05:47.246 --> 00:05:49.326 
You can have the best algorithm
in the world.

00:05:49.366 --> 00:05:52.566 
But if the data is bad,
or poorly classified,

00:05:52.766 --> 00:05:54.086 
the results will be too.

00:05:55.246 --> 00:05:56.646 
The data challenge.

00:05:58.446 --> 00:06:02.966 
For example, if we train an algorithm
to recognise a sheep in a picture

00:06:03.046 --> 00:06:05.286 
by showing it white sheep,

00:06:05.326 --> 00:06:07.286 
it won't be able to recognise black sheep.

00:06:07.366 --> 00:06:10.606 
The data must be varied
and sufficiently numerous.

00:06:10.646 --> 00:06:13.326 
Without this,
generalisation is not possible.

00:06:13.726 --> 00:06:15.526 
You also need well classified data.

00:06:15.886 --> 00:06:18.966 
To properly train AI
to recognise sheep in a picture,

00:06:19.006 --> 00:06:21.326 
not only do you need many sheep pictures,

00:06:21.366 --> 00:06:24.246 
but they also have to be well annotated.

00:06:24.286 --> 00:06:27.086 
In other words, in this case,
the sheep is framed

00:06:27.126 --> 00:06:29.846 
and that it is specified that the frame
corresponds to a sheep.

00:06:32.646 --> 00:06:35.326 
As we have seen,
this involves thousands of images

00:06:35.366 --> 00:06:38.726 
which must be annotated by hand
so that the AI can learn correctly

00:06:38.766 --> 00:06:40.566 
and then make good predictions afterwards

00:06:40.606 --> 00:06:43.206 
from images which are no longer annotated.

00:06:44.166 --> 00:06:48.086 
A long and arduous task,
but also very important

00:06:48.126 --> 00:06:51.166 
because bad annotations
lead to bad predictions.

00:06:52.566 --> 00:06:55.286 
Sometimes we annotate data
without even realising it.

00:06:55.366 --> 00:06:57.086 
You know, like some CAPTCHAs

00:06:57.126 --> 00:06:59.646 
where you have to find the boxes
that have cars in them.

00:07:00.046 --> 00:07:04.246 
You are annotating an image or checking
that it has been properly annotated,

00:07:04.286 --> 00:07:07.686 
and not necessarily proving
that you are a human being.

00:07:07.726 --> 00:07:10.846 
What's more,
there is a great deal of invisible work

00:07:10.886 --> 00:07:13.846 
done by humans
who are paid a few euros per day

00:07:13.886 --> 00:07:15.846 
to click on hundreds of images.

00:07:15.886 --> 00:07:17.926 
Have you heard about
Amazon's Mechanical Turk?

00:07:17.966 --> 00:07:19.886 
Yes, I went to the site.

00:07:20.326 --> 00:07:23.086 
-Indeed, the rates are ridiculous.
-The click workers.

00:07:23.486 --> 00:07:25.646 
Where does the data come from?

00:07:25.726 --> 00:07:28.206 
Data can be collected automatically

00:07:28.246 --> 00:07:32.966 
via sensors such as telescopes,
surveillance cameras, microphones

00:07:33.206 --> 00:07:35.726 
and sensors measuring air quality.

00:07:35.966 --> 00:07:39.086 
They can also be produced by users,

00:07:39.126 --> 00:07:41.806 
in particular via the queries
submitted to a search engine,

00:07:42.006 --> 00:07:44.886 
publications, comments on social networks,

00:07:44.926 --> 00:07:49.326 
connected objects and purchases
made on a credit card.

00:07:50.286 --> 00:07:53.646 
It is an exchange of free services
between the big groups and us.

00:07:53.686 --> 00:07:54.526 
That's it.

00:07:54.566 --> 00:07:56.326 
When it's free, you are the product.

00:07:57.166 --> 00:07:59.126 
Yes, it's true.

00:07:59.166 --> 00:08:03.686 
The big American or Chinese private groups
have large amounts of data on tap,

00:08:03.726 --> 00:08:05.686 
which raises problems related to independence.

00:08:05.966 --> 00:08:08.846 
Today in China,
a social node system has been set up

00:08:08.886 --> 00:08:11.046 
to evaluate citizens' behaviour.

00:08:11.686 --> 00:08:14.606 
Data is mainly collected
via surveillance cameras,

00:08:14.646 --> 00:08:18.126 
social networks,
and an AI assigns a score that allows

00:08:18.166 --> 00:08:20.486 
or not to access public service.

00:08:21.566 --> 00:08:25.086 
This mass of data is boosting
start-ups at the same time

00:08:25.126 --> 00:08:28.246 
because whoever has the data
has the power to run the models

00:08:28.286 --> 00:08:29.326 
and improve them.

00:08:29.366 --> 00:08:32.926 
Hence the importance of the GDPR
to regulate all these practices,

00:08:32.966 --> 00:08:35.446 
so that the European states
and their citizens

00:08:35.486 --> 00:08:38.206 
have a little more control
over their personal data.

00:08:38.286 --> 00:08:41.446 
Big data consumes a lot, doesn't it?

00:08:42.086 --> 00:08:44.646 
Data is stored in data centres.

00:08:44.686 --> 00:08:47.686 
The cloud is not an actual cloud.
It's pizza boxes,

00:08:47.726 --> 00:08:51.126 
entire server towers
that heat up and need to be cooled

00:08:51.166 --> 00:08:52.326 
with air conditioning.

00:08:52.366 --> 00:08:55.086 
Algorithms, when they are at AI level

00:08:55.286 --> 00:08:58.726 
need exceptional computing capacity,

00:08:58.926 --> 00:09:02.646 
which means supercomputers
which bring together several dozen

00:09:02.686 --> 00:09:05.566 
of thousands of processors
in huge buildings.

00:09:05.966 --> 00:09:09.526 
Yes, it consumes a lot
and it's a risk for the whole system.

00:09:09.926 --> 00:09:12.526 
It is up to us to be vigilant
about the cost-effectiveness

00:09:12.566 --> 00:09:14.206

00:09:18.206 --> 00:09:21.886 
but also there are also apps
that push us to consume or track us.

00:09:21.926 --> 00:09:24.766 
Like any technology,
it depends on how it is used.

00:09:24.846 --> 00:09:26.846 
It's up to us to make sense of it!
