00:00:10.206 --> 00:00:12.966 
Is Artificial intelligence working for us?

00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:16.046 
AI is all around us,

00:00:16.326 --> 00:00:20.646 
and asks societal, democratic, ethical
and political questions.

00:00:21.406 --> 00:00:22.886 
Who and what does it work for?

00:00:23.246 --> 00:00:24.046 
Who controls whom?

00:00:24.326 --> 00:00:25.726 
What role will we let it play?

00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:27.846 
In short, what kind of society
do we want to live in?

00:00:28.486 --> 00:00:31.766 
The exciting part
of research on artificial intelligence

00:00:31.806 --> 00:00:33.206 
is that it allows us to make advances

00:00:33.246 --> 00:00:34.926 
on our understanding
of human intelligence.

00:00:35.326 --> 00:00:38.326 
At the same time,
the debates about this technology

00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:40.526 
push us to reflect on what makes us human,

00:00:40.846 --> 00:00:43.326 
our place as citizens and our societies.

00:00:44.086 --> 00:00:46.006 
It's a huge topic
that merits your attention.

00:00:47.326 --> 00:00:48.486 
Shall we think about it together?

00:00:49.286 --> 00:00:50.806 
Emotions and creativity.

00:00:52.326 --> 00:00:55.446 
Firstly, I would like to question
the human-machine relationship.

00:00:55.526 --> 00:00:57.006 
To simulate human intelligence,

00:00:57.246 --> 00:01:00.806 
AI attempts to replicate
human cognitive functions.

00:01:01.126 --> 00:01:04.126 
Reasoning, motor skills,
language and vision,

00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:05.006 
but that's not all.

00:01:05.086 --> 00:01:08.606 
Being creative is also part
of these cognitive functions.

00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:10.846 
As I'm speaking,

00:01:11.286 --> 00:01:15.006 
AIs are creating music,
books, film scripts,

00:01:15.406 --> 00:01:17.566 
-paintings...
-and even pizza.

00:01:19.046 --> 00:01:20.846 
The results can be amazing.

00:01:21.606 --> 00:01:23.566 
Well, I can't say just yet
in the case of pizza,

00:01:23.606 --> 00:01:24.606 
as I haven't tasted it.

00:01:24.886 --> 00:01:27.846 
Does this mean that AI is creative?

00:01:27.926 --> 00:01:30.766 
I have to say that we are still far
from Hergé or the Beatles!

00:01:31.446 --> 00:01:34.166 
Current AIs that we design
are not capable of inventing.

00:01:34.566 --> 00:01:36.046 
On the other hand, they can imitate.

00:01:37.046 --> 00:01:38.126 
According to Albertine Meunier,

00:01:38.486 --> 00:01:41.206 
a digital artist
who uses the web as material,

00:01:41.646 --> 00:01:43.006 
AI is only a tool,

00:01:43.246 --> 00:01:45.886 
but it offers an infinite number
of possibilities, new shapes

00:01:46.086 --> 00:01:48.366 
and options we wouldn't have thought of.

00:01:49.326 --> 00:01:51.446 
And can machines have emotions?

00:01:51.726 --> 00:01:54.366 
Machines can behave like us in appearance.

00:01:54.726 --> 00:01:57.406 
Significant progress has been made
to detect human emotion

00:01:57.726 --> 00:02:00.286 
and react accordingly
with the appropriate emotion.

00:02:00.646 --> 00:02:02.646 
But, as Laurence Devillers said,

00:02:02.726 --> 00:02:04.966 
research director at LIMSI/CNRS,

00:02:05.326 --> 00:02:07.166 
Machines don't feel anything.
They simulate.

00:02:07.806 --> 00:02:10.926 
But you can make people believe
that they feel something

00:02:11.206 --> 00:02:12.846 
using sensors, for example.

00:02:13.286 --> 00:02:15.646 
If you touch the sensor,
a signal is detected,

00:02:15.966 --> 00:02:17.046 
and the machine reacts

00:02:17.846 --> 00:02:19.846 
But in fact, we don't even really need

00:02:19.886 --> 00:02:21.446 
to have a robot around the program.

00:02:21.526 --> 00:02:23.166 
Voice alone is enough to captivate us.

00:02:23.406 --> 00:02:25.206 
Just look at the effect
of the voice speakers.

00:02:25.606 --> 00:02:27.966 
In 300 metres, turn right.

00:02:28.766 --> 00:02:31.406 
We must not neglect our inclination
towards anthropomorphism,

00:02:31.446 --> 00:02:32.726 
which is very powerful.

00:02:33.166 --> 00:02:34.446 
If I ask myself all these questions,

00:02:34.886 --> 00:02:36.766 
it seems necessary to me to question

00:02:36.806 --> 00:02:38.566 
the relationship
we're going to have with these machines,

00:02:38.806 --> 00:02:40.646 
and above all, where they will fit in.

00:02:41.286 --> 00:02:42.646 
Decision-making aids?

00:02:44.366 --> 00:02:46.406 
Artificial intelligence algorithms

00:02:46.806 --> 00:02:50.286 
don't just reproduce
mechanical tasks for us.

00:02:50.646 --> 00:02:53.486 
They can be great decision-support tools

00:02:53.726 --> 00:02:57.326 
in a lot of sectors
like transport, banking, insurance

00:02:57.526 --> 00:02:58.366 
and protection.

00:02:58.726 --> 00:03:01.406 
One of the most interesting areas
is medicine.

00:03:02.086 --> 00:03:03.006 
For example,

00:03:03.086 --> 00:03:08.206 
algorithms can help diagnose tumours
by analysing X-rays.

00:03:08.566 --> 00:03:11.926 
In the future,
algorithms could diagnose appendicitis

00:03:12.166 --> 00:03:13.646 
or predict the appearance of a tumour

00:03:13.966 --> 00:03:15.766 
before it is visible on the image.

00:03:16.406 --> 00:03:17.566 
This is incredible!

00:03:17.886 --> 00:03:18.686 
It's great.

00:03:19.406 --> 00:03:20.846 
Of course,
as long as everything goes to plan.

00:03:21.326 --> 00:03:23.486 
Algorithms can be flawed.

00:03:23.846 --> 00:03:27.966 
It's nothing serious when deciding
on toothbrush recommendations,

00:03:28.366 --> 00:03:32.046 
but what if these decisions
have an impact on my personal life,

00:03:32.286 --> 00:03:34.686 
in the medical or judicial field?

00:03:35.406 --> 00:03:37.566 
You can't just respond,

00:03:37.886 --> 00:03:40.326 
"I had nothing to do with it, officer.
It was the machine's decision".

00:03:40.686 --> 00:03:41.526 
No!

00:03:41.606 --> 00:03:43.886 
It's essential to provide explanations

00:03:44.126 --> 00:03:46.886 
and justifications for the recommendations
that have been made,

00:03:47.206 --> 00:03:48.406 
or the decisions taken, right?

00:03:48.886 --> 00:03:51.366 
That's the whole point
of what we call "explainability".

00:03:51.646 --> 00:03:53.846 
The technique that is trending today,

00:03:54.126 --> 00:03:55.766 
deep neural network learning,

00:03:56.046 --> 00:03:57.006 
or deep learning,

00:03:57.326 --> 00:03:58.966 
works a bit like a black box.

00:03:59.606 --> 00:04:00.806 
We can't really explain

00:04:00.846 --> 00:04:02.686 
how the neural network gets its results,

00:04:02.926 --> 00:04:05.126 
at least in a way
that is intelligible to a human being.

00:04:05.406 --> 00:04:08.366 
So there is research
to make these systems more transparent,

00:04:08.606 --> 00:04:10.686 
and in addition,
we are making huge progress in this area.

00:04:11.286 --> 00:04:14.006 
Alexei Grinbaum,
a philosopher of science CERNA

00:04:14.046 --> 00:04:14.846 
and CEA physicist,

00:04:15.366 --> 00:04:18.006 
explains that we need to design a system

00:04:18.206 --> 00:04:19.926 
in such a way
that it will always be possible

00:04:19.966 --> 00:04:21.246 
to trace the causal chains

00:04:21.526 --> 00:04:24.166 
that led to any action
or decision made by the machine.

00:04:24.606 --> 00:04:27.246 
For example,
putting another learning system

00:04:27.446 --> 00:04:29.286 
to explain what the first system does,

00:04:29.646 --> 00:04:31.766 
provides the first look
at what is going on inside.

00:04:32.406 --> 00:04:35.766 
The black box effect
masks the origin of bias.

00:04:35.846 --> 00:04:38.526 
These biases come
from the data used to train the program,

00:04:38.846 --> 00:04:40.846 
but it isn't easy
to analyse it afterwards.

00:04:41.366 --> 00:04:44.566 
The programme needs vast amounts
of data to learn.

00:04:44.646 --> 00:04:45.526 
As they say,

00:04:45.566 --> 00:04:47.646 
it understands quickly,
but it needs a long explanation.

00:04:48.246 --> 00:04:49.446 
Not enough data,

00:04:50.046 --> 00:04:50.846 
or not varied enough,

00:04:51.406 --> 00:04:53.446 
or badly annotated
can lead to poor results.

00:04:53.726 --> 00:04:56.846 
For example, if we train an algorithm
to recognise a sheep in a picture...

00:04:56.926 --> 00:04:58.046 
Baaah!

00:04:58.086 --> 00:04:59.646 
...and it is only shown black sheep,

00:04:59.686 --> 00:05:01.246 
it will not be able
to recognise any white sheep.

00:05:01.646 --> 00:05:03.326 
And then they call the AI racist!

00:05:03.846 --> 00:05:06.366 
In fact, the data is biased
by our own stereotypes.

00:05:06.686 --> 00:05:08.766 
A machine trained with biased data

00:05:09.166 --> 00:05:11.366 
reproduces these biases
without even understanding them.

00:05:11.606 --> 00:05:12.406 
Baaah!

00:05:12.886 --> 00:05:15.606 
A study published
in the journal Science in 2017

00:05:15.966 --> 00:05:18.726 
has shown that many biases exist
in human language.

00:05:19.246 --> 00:05:23.526 
The word man is more often associated
with terms for leadership positions

00:05:23.726 --> 00:05:25.806 
in the science or engineering sectors.

00:05:26.126 --> 00:05:27.406 
In contrast, the word woman

00:05:27.646 --> 00:05:31.366 
is associated with assistant positions
in the arts and humanities sector.

00:05:31.686 --> 00:05:35.166 
Also, African-American names
lead to bad words.

00:05:35.846 --> 00:05:37.566 
So, if you don't pay attention

00:05:37.646 --> 00:05:42.246 
when it comes to AI choosing a candidate
for an engineer position,

00:05:42.486 --> 00:05:44.406 
the CV of a black woman
will go to the bottom of the pile.

00:05:45.566 --> 00:05:48.446 
Serge Abiteboul, a researcher
at the Computer Science Department

00:05:48.486 --> 00:05:50.046 
of the École Normale Supérieure,

00:05:50.246 --> 00:05:53.326 
tells us about an amazing experiment
done in Israel.

00:05:53.846 --> 00:05:57.846 
They realised that the probability
of being released by going before a judge

00:05:58.046 --> 00:06:00.966 
was greater after lunch than before.

00:06:01.886 --> 00:06:04.646 
It makes me wonder
about my own decision criteria.

00:06:04.966 --> 00:06:07.886 
Well,
luckily, they have other decision factors

00:06:07.926 --> 00:06:09.126 
than how full their stomachs are.

00:06:09.406 --> 00:06:13.566 
In any case, we can say that AI
always reproduces the same behaviour

00:06:13.886 --> 00:06:15.726 
from the data provided.

00:06:16.246 --> 00:06:18.166 
Once again we see data's importance

00:06:18.366 --> 00:06:20.446 
and the motivations
of those who design these machines.

00:06:21.366 --> 00:06:23.046 
A democratic issue.

00:06:24.566 --> 00:06:27.806 
It's the eternal question
of the tool and what to do with it.

00:06:28.326 --> 00:06:31.726 
Of course, it's the humans
who define the software's objectives.

00:06:32.246 --> 00:06:33.446 
We can discuss this with them,

00:06:33.686 --> 00:06:35.326 
in fact, it's a must.

00:06:35.726 --> 00:06:36.726 
And there are not only philanthropists!

00:06:37.206 --> 00:06:40.126 
Even when you have the best intentions
in the world,

00:06:40.166 --> 00:06:41.286 
the question remains,

00:06:41.686 --> 00:06:42.486 
who should decide?

00:06:43.046 --> 00:06:46.246 
Serge Abiteboul said
that it's not up to the IT people

00:06:46.606 --> 00:06:50.126 
to decide how to develop an algorithm
that calculates students' fate,

00:06:50.406 --> 00:06:52.086 
just like it shouldn't be Google

00:06:52.126 --> 00:06:54.686 
that decides to ban extremist
or fake news sites.

00:06:55.246 --> 00:06:56.806 
The digital world has developed so fast

00:06:57.166 --> 00:06:59.526 
that it is still in the western stage,

00:06:59.766 --> 00:07:01.086 
injustice is everywhere,

00:07:01.126 --> 00:07:03.966 
the state does not understand enough
to legislate properly

00:07:04.206 --> 00:07:05.366 
and the citizens are lost.

00:07:06.406 --> 00:07:08.286 
Many researchers agree that

00:07:08.526 --> 00:07:11.166 
machines can help us evolve our decisions

00:07:11.206 --> 00:07:12.926 
by offering us ideas and solutions,

00:07:13.206 --> 00:07:14.366 
but it's up to humans

00:07:14.686 --> 00:07:16.806 
to decide which rules
the machines should follow

00:07:17.046 --> 00:07:20.046 
and, in case of doubt,
to make the final decision.

00:07:20.566 --> 00:07:22.206 
So what should we do
while we wait for the sheriff?

00:07:22.486 --> 00:07:24.606 
We are addressing the conscience
of the people who create the algorithms.

00:07:25.046 --> 00:07:26.726 
We create ethical rules.

00:07:26.766 --> 00:07:30.166 
The citizens are given keys
so that they can mobilise if necessary.

00:07:30.246 --> 00:07:31.606 
This is what we are doing!

00:07:31.806 --> 00:07:33.046 
Yes Theo, exactly,

00:07:33.246 --> 00:07:34.606 
one building block at a time.

00:07:34.686 --> 00:07:37.606 
Anyway, I hope this humble work,

00:07:37.646 --> 00:07:39.046 
made entirely by humans,

00:07:39.246 --> 00:07:40.646 
will help you to see it more clearly.

00:07:40.966 --> 00:07:43.486 
It's up to all of us
to embrace artificial intelligence

00:07:43.766 --> 00:07:46.966 
and invent new uses
to make our lives easier,

00:07:47.006 --> 00:07:48.046 
more interesting

00:07:48.366 --> 00:07:49.606 
or simply more beautiful.
