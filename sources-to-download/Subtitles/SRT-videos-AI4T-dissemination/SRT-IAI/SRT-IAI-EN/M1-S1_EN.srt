1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,078
Hold on! I know who to call. You'll see.

2
00:00:04,766 --> 00:00:05,726
The hotline.

3
00:00:05,766 --> 00:00:07,968
Guillaume. Hello. Long time no speak.

4
00:00:07,993 --> 00:00:09,433
What brings you here today?

5
00:00:09,745 --> 00:00:11,941
-Artificial intelligence.
-That's great.

6
00:00:11,981 --> 00:00:14,587
The more I hear about it,
the less I understand it.

7
00:00:14,612 --> 00:00:16,126
I used to think it was great.

8
00:00:16,166 --> 00:00:19,955
I'm with my cousin Theo who just showed me
an article about Stephen Hawking,

9
00:00:20,033 --> 00:00:22,400
-you know, the greatest researcher ever,
-Yes.

10
00:00:22,462 --> 00:00:25,361
-who says, "The development
of full artificial intelligence

11
00:00:25,386 --> 00:00:27,211
could spell the end of the human race."

12
00:00:27,289 --> 00:00:29,258
Yeah, it's pretty scary what the guy says.

13
00:00:29,906 --> 00:00:31,383
Who is afraid of AI?

14
00:00:33,363 --> 00:00:34,566
Yes, but Guillaume,

15
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:36,649
you have to ask yourself who is talking?

16
00:00:36,686 --> 00:00:39,004
-I told you, it's my cousin Theo.
-Hi.

17
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,918
No, I mean Stephen Hawking.

18
00:00:40,943 --> 00:00:43,036
He was a top scientist in cosmology,

19
00:00:43,136 --> 00:00:44,599
but AI is not his field.

20
00:00:44,624 --> 00:00:47,302
Instead, listen to a real expert
on the subject,

21
00:00:47,411 --> 00:00:50,918
such as Jean-Gabriel Ganascia,
who is a computer science researcher

22
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:53,840
and head of the ethics committee
at the CNRS.

23
00:00:55,086 --> 00:00:57,166
The term is still misunderstood.

24
00:00:57,206 --> 00:00:59,343
Many people say, "Does it exist?

25
00:00:59,473 --> 00:01:01,713
Do you believe
in artificial intelligence?"

26
00:01:01,738 --> 00:01:04,440
because they imagine
that it's a kind of fantasy,

27
00:01:04,511 --> 00:01:07,331
the idea that a machine
will suddenly be brought to life

28
00:01:07,356 --> 00:01:08,436
by intelligence.

29
00:01:08,614 --> 00:01:10,675
I will show you that this is not the case.

30
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,535
Artificial intelligence
is a scientific discipline.

31
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,035
That's what's important.

32
00:01:15,246 --> 00:01:17,616
Yes, of course, there are fantasies

33
00:01:17,641 --> 00:01:20,137
about artificial characters
with intelligence.

34
00:01:20,254 --> 00:01:21,806
Pinocchio, Frankenstein.

35
00:01:21,846 --> 00:01:24,246
Terminator, they're going to kill us all.

36
00:01:24,713 --> 00:01:26,574
No, let me stop you right there.

37
00:01:26,652 --> 00:01:28,846
A robot is not necessarily an AI,

38
00:01:28,871 --> 00:01:30,900
it's a mechanical carcass with sensors

39
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:32,042
and a computer in it,

40
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,558
and only sometimes,

41
00:01:33,583 --> 00:01:36,652
there are algorithms
called artificial intelligence inside.

42
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:40,007
In contrast, Theo,
look at your smartphone.

43
00:01:40,032 --> 00:01:41,421
It doesn't look like a robot.

44
00:01:41,446 --> 00:01:42,796
There's no AI in there.

45
00:01:42,821 --> 00:01:45,078
-Yes, there is.
-Exactly.

46
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:46,719
Getting back to the Terminator.

47
00:01:46,744 --> 00:01:48,899
In the real world,
there is no intelligence capable

48
00:01:48,924 --> 00:01:50,845
of doing everything like we see in films,

49
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,243
and there's no saying it will ever happen.

50
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:55,936
After that, everyone is free
to believe what they want,

51
00:01:55,961 --> 00:01:58,366
but these are only beliefs, not science.

52
00:01:59,313 --> 00:02:01,172
But Elon Musk and other figures,

53
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:02,908
including Internet bosses,

54
00:02:03,112 --> 00:02:06,454
are also very concerned,
even though they are the ones

55
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,159
-developing these technologies.
-That's true.

56
00:02:09,184 --> 00:02:10,864
Yes, it smells like a scam.

57
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:12,528
We must not become paranoid.

58
00:02:12,562 --> 00:02:15,076
Of course,
these technologies raise important ethical

59
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:17,599
and societal questions,
which must be addressed

60
00:02:17,624 --> 00:02:19,256
as scientific advances are made.

61
00:02:20,329 --> 00:02:23,117
"Science without conscience
is but the ruin of the soul",

62
00:02:23,142 --> 00:02:25,454
said Rabelais in the 15th century.

63
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,071
Bravo, Guillaume.

64
00:02:27,532 --> 00:02:30,304
Yes, all the current concerns
are perfectly legitimate

65
00:02:30,329 --> 00:02:32,686
because AI has a real impact on society.

66
00:02:33,165 --> 00:02:35,806
Everyone must understand
what it is really about

67
00:02:35,831 --> 00:02:37,290
so that we can discuss the economic

68
00:02:37,315 --> 00:02:39,540
and societal choices that must be made.

69
00:02:40,736 --> 00:02:42,820
You see, Theo, your father is right.

70
00:02:42,845 --> 00:02:45,172
You don't need to be a mechanic
to drive a car,

71
00:02:45,197 --> 00:02:47,273
but it's still better
to look under the bonnet

72
00:02:47,298 --> 00:02:50,141
to see how it works
and especially how it brakes.

73
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:51,910
We'll look into it. OK?

74
00:02:51,935 --> 00:02:52,833
OK.

75
00:02:53,246 --> 00:02:55,726
What is artificial intelligence?
