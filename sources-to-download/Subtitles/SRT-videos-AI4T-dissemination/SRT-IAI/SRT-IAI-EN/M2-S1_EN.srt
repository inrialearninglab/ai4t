00:00:01.446 --> 00:00:02.526 
The hotline.

00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:05.366 
Guillaume. What's on your mind today?

00:00:05.406 --> 00:00:09.046 
My cousin Theo told me about a pizza
powered by artificial intelligence.

00:00:09.086 --> 00:00:10.086 
There's no way.

00:00:10.126 --> 00:00:13.086 
No, he is right.
The food industry is also in on it.

00:00:13.126 --> 00:00:15.286 
I wonder what it would taste like.

00:00:15.326 --> 00:00:17.926 
Have you ever licked a circuit board?

00:00:18.526 --> 00:00:21.526 
How do they get
artificial intelligence into a pizza?

00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:22.846 
I'm missing something here.

00:00:23.326 --> 00:00:25.246 
AI on everything?

00:00:26.446 --> 00:00:28.686 
They don't really put AI in the pizza.

00:00:28.726 --> 00:00:32.046 
They put lots of data
in a machine learning model.

00:00:32.086 --> 00:00:34.366 
For example, data about ingredients,

00:00:34.406 --> 00:00:37.846 
customer preferences, recipe trials
and tester feedback.

00:00:37.886 --> 00:00:40.006 
Using all this data,

00:00:40.046 --> 00:00:42.606 
the model will generate
many different recipes,

00:00:42.646 --> 00:00:44.686 
without preconceived ideas
about their taste,

00:00:44.726 --> 00:00:47.406 
and predict
whether they will appeal to customers.

00:00:47.446 --> 00:00:49.286 
Wait a minute. If I understand correctly,

00:00:49.326 --> 00:00:51.686 
you are telling me
that our society now uses

00:00:51.726 --> 00:00:54.166 
-statistics to create pizzas?
-Yes.

00:00:54.206 --> 00:00:56.686 
Machine learning algorithms can be used

00:00:56.726 --> 00:00:59.726 
in many areas,
and marketing is no exception

00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:02.166 
as long as data can be fed
into the models.

00:01:02.206 --> 00:01:03.806 
Does it need a lot of data?

00:01:03.846 --> 00:01:05.646 
Yes, you need lots of data.

00:01:05.686 --> 00:01:07.526 
Besides, the more data you give them,

00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:11.366 
the more machine learning models learn
how to predict the next data correctly.

00:01:11.726 --> 00:01:13.006 
Do you see what I mean?

00:01:13.046 --> 00:01:15.566 
I can better see how big data connects,
but it still doesn't add up.

00:01:15.606 --> 00:01:16.926 
I need to dig deeper.
