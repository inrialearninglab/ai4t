1
00:00:09,806 --> 00:00:12,326
What is artificial intelligence?

2
00:00:14,286 --> 00:00:17,926
Hi! I've been looking
into this artificial intelligence thing.

3
00:00:17,966 --> 00:00:19,246
It's fascinating.

4
00:00:19,326 --> 00:00:22,926
I investigated and spoke
with experts and researchers.

5
00:00:23,006 --> 00:00:25,526
I read articles, attended conferences,

6
00:00:25,566 --> 00:00:27,046
delved deeper, and dug.

7
00:00:27,126 --> 00:00:29,726
I went all the way to the Pharaoh's tomb.

8
00:00:29,766 --> 00:00:32,646
Basically, I went as far as I could.

9
00:00:32,686 --> 00:00:34,366
Watch out! This is serious stuff.

10
00:00:35,246 --> 00:00:37,766
By the way, we thought of you
because we gave you all the sources.

11
00:00:37,806 --> 00:00:39,606
That way, you can check for yourself

12
00:00:39,686 --> 00:00:42,806
and, above all,
explore the subjects that interest you.

13
00:00:42,886 --> 00:00:45,486
All good? Here we go.

14
00:00:46,206 --> 00:00:47,726
History of Algorithms.

15
00:00:49,886 --> 00:00:53,086
Algorithms are all around us.

16
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:56,246
Content recommendations
on Facebook are algorithms.

17
00:00:56,286 --> 00:01:00,766
GPS location that tells me
about traffic jams is an algorithm.

18
00:01:00,806 --> 00:01:02,726
-Facial recognition...
-Algorithm.

19
00:01:02,806 --> 00:01:06,006
Good. Yes, but what are algorithms?

20
00:01:06,246 --> 00:01:08,766
Let's start from the beginning, computing.

21
00:01:08,806 --> 00:01:11,966
Computing is about processing information

22
00:01:12,006 --> 00:01:14,006
automatically.

23
00:01:14,086 --> 00:01:17,446
It relies on machines
capable of processing data

24
00:01:17,486 --> 00:01:18,766
-thanks to...
-Algorithms.

25
00:01:18,806 --> 00:01:22,406
Good, Theo, that's good.
You're with me, that's nice.

26
00:01:22,646 --> 00:01:24,006
Now, algorithms,

27
00:01:24,046 --> 00:01:26,286
stop me if I'm wrong, are a bit like...

28
00:01:27,006 --> 00:01:28,926
a cooking recipe.

29
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:31,886
It is a series of instructions
to be followed in a certain order

30
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:33,966
to perform a task automatically.

31
00:01:34,006 --> 00:01:38,126
Automatically means without the need
to understand or think.

32
00:01:38,206 --> 00:01:40,206
This is perfect for a machine.

33
00:01:40,766 --> 00:01:42,766
Once you have this list of instructions,

34
00:01:42,806 --> 00:01:45,686
you translate it into a language
that a computer can understand,

35
00:01:45,726 --> 00:01:48,726
and you get a computer program.

36
00:01:49,046 --> 00:01:54,886
Computers run any program that describes
an algorithm perfectly and very quickly,

37
00:01:54,926 --> 00:01:56,286
and that's very impressive.

38
00:01:56,326 --> 00:01:59,686
Moreover, in the 1950s,
researchers began to dream.

39
00:01:59,726 --> 00:02:03,246
They imagined algorithms
that would make computers

40
00:02:03,286 --> 00:02:05,286
as intelligent as humans.

41
00:02:05,846 --> 00:02:08,126
As Nicolas Rougier,
an Inria researcher, explains,

42
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:11,646
there were some great advances
up until the end of the 1970s,

43
00:02:11,686 --> 00:02:13,086
but then we were discouraged.

44
00:02:13,126 --> 00:02:14,726
The promised results were not forthcoming.

45
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:17,006
Research funds stopped flowing,

46
00:02:17,046 --> 00:02:19,246
and there was the first AI winter.

47
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:22,966
Ten years later,
there was a surge in expert systems

48
00:02:23,006 --> 00:02:26,646
that tried to reproduce the reasoning
of a specialist such as a doctor.

49
00:02:26,686 --> 00:02:29,526
Still, the human knowledge
had to be put into the machines,

50
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:32,566
whereas what we wanted was
for the machines to learn by themselves.

51
00:02:32,766 --> 00:02:34,726
A second AI winter happened.

52
00:02:34,766 --> 00:02:37,126
At the end of the 1990s,
a breakthrough came.

53
00:02:37,206 --> 00:02:39,806
Deep Blue, IBM's supercomputer,

54
00:02:39,846 --> 00:02:42,766
beat the world chess champion,
Garry Kasparov.

55
00:02:42,806 --> 00:02:46,846
In 2016, another breakthrough,
a Google algorithm

56
00:02:46,886 --> 00:02:48,726
beat one of the best Go players
in the world,

57
00:02:48,766 --> 00:02:51,486
despite not having been thought possible
for several years.

58
00:02:52,206 --> 00:02:55,526
In fact,
the history of artificial intelligence

59
00:02:55,566 --> 00:02:57,846
alternates between high-profile advances

60
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,166
and major disappointments.

61
00:02:59,206 --> 00:03:01,526
Now we're back in the boom phase.

62
00:03:01,566 --> 00:03:05,086
Have our computers
become intelligent or not?

63
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:07,966
We should clearly understand and define

64
00:03:08,006 --> 00:03:12,726
what biological intelligence is
to define artificial intelligence.

65
00:03:12,806 --> 00:03:17,086
Before, being an excellent chess player
was a sign of intelligence.

66
00:03:17,126 --> 00:03:21,366
Today, that is no longer enough
because the machine does it automatically.

67
00:03:21,406 --> 00:03:23,686
Biological intelligence is defined

68
00:03:23,766 --> 00:03:26,966
in the same way
as artificial intelligence,

69
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:28,686
which is a fascinating question.

70
00:03:28,726 --> 00:03:30,846
I will try to explain to you today

71
00:03:30,886 --> 00:03:34,886
what biological intelligence is in 2020.

72
00:03:35,366 --> 00:03:37,086
Biological intelligence.

73
00:03:38,486 --> 00:03:40,406
At the same time
as artificial intelligence,

74
00:03:40,446 --> 00:03:44,446
the cognitive sciences were born,
which study human intelligence.

75
00:03:44,686 --> 00:03:47,366
They have made it possible
to identify the various mechanisms

76
00:03:47,406 --> 00:03:49,926
at work in the way thought functions.

77
00:03:49,966 --> 00:03:54,446
This thought allows us
to perceive, speak, move,

78
00:03:54,486 --> 00:03:59,126
memorise, reason, plan,
be abstract at times

79
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:01,086
or creative for the best of us.

80
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,286
These are our cognitive functions.

81
00:04:03,846 --> 00:04:05,566
To stimulate human intelligence,

82
00:04:05,606 --> 00:04:08,526
the idea was
to reproduce cognitive functions.

83
00:04:08,766 --> 00:04:11,806
To achieve this,
the researchers favoured two approaches

84
00:04:11,846 --> 00:04:14,286
which are somewhat similar
to how we learn,

85
00:04:14,326 --> 00:04:17,566
either through the transmission
of knowledge or through trial and error

86
00:04:17,606 --> 00:04:20,726
based on observation
of the world and experimentation.

87
00:04:20,766 --> 00:04:23,086
The two complement each other.

88
00:04:23,766 --> 00:04:27,246
The symbolic approach tries to imitate
how humans reason logically

89
00:04:27,286 --> 00:04:28,966
and use their knowledge.

90
00:04:29,566 --> 00:04:32,686
As Thalita Firmo Drumond,
an Inria doctoral student, explains,

91
00:04:32,726 --> 00:04:35,926
a certain amount of knowledge
is transmitted to us through experiences,

92
00:04:35,966 --> 00:04:37,846
rules and procedures.

93
00:04:38,366 --> 00:04:40,846
This is how school learning,

94
00:04:40,886 --> 00:04:43,126
such as learning how to add, is done.

95
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:44,486
When I add something,

96
00:04:44,526 --> 00:04:46,846
I can explain how I do it step by step.

97
00:04:47,286 --> 00:04:49,566
It is then possible to write a program

98
00:04:49,606 --> 00:04:52,806
explaining to the machine
how to proceed step by step.

99
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:56,286
The machine will then be able
to perform it much faster than I can

100
00:04:56,326 --> 00:04:57,726
and without any mistakes.

101
00:04:58,446 --> 00:05:00,686
This approach has given rise
to expert systems

102
00:05:00,726 --> 00:05:03,126
that try to reproduce the reasoning
of a specialist,

103
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:06,006
such as a doctor or lawyer,
to solve a problem.

104
00:05:06,246 --> 00:05:09,806
This approach was very popular
in the 1980s.

105
00:05:11,006 --> 00:05:12,926
Other knowledge comes from experience,

106
00:05:12,966 --> 00:05:15,086
where it is much more difficult to explain

107
00:05:15,126 --> 00:05:16,926
how it is achieved, such as

108
00:05:16,966 --> 00:05:19,206
riding a bike or recognising a cat.

109
00:05:19,246 --> 00:05:21,166
I can explain to you how to ride a bike,

110
00:05:21,206 --> 00:05:23,166
but you'll only know
how to ride if you pedal.

111
00:05:23,206 --> 00:05:25,206
You have to experience it.

112
00:05:25,566 --> 00:05:29,846
The other approach,
the digital or connectionist approach,

113
00:05:29,886 --> 00:05:33,246
tries to imitate
how humans learn by trial and error

114
00:05:33,286 --> 00:05:34,966
from their experiences.

115
00:05:35,246 --> 00:05:36,606
This approach is the one

116
00:05:36,646 --> 00:05:38,646
that is in the spotlight today.

117
00:05:39,046 --> 00:05:42,286
You know, machine learning
and the famous neural networks.

118
00:05:42,566 --> 00:05:45,246
OK, but you still haven't answered
the real question.

119
00:05:45,286 --> 00:05:46,726
What is intelligence?

120
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:49,406
Biological intelligence?
I'm getting there.

121
00:05:49,446 --> 00:05:53,246
Frédéric Alexandre,
a computational neuroscience researcher,

122
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:55,046
gives us the following answer.

123
00:05:55,126 --> 00:05:57,646
"Intelligence means being able
to respond quickly

124
00:05:57,686 --> 00:05:59,246
to a complex situation.

125
00:05:59,966 --> 00:06:03,366
Intelligence means finding
the right answer

126
00:06:03,406 --> 00:06:05,646
rather than the best one.

127
00:06:05,886 --> 00:06:09,366
Intelligence means finding out
what is important in the information.

128
00:06:09,606 --> 00:06:13,086
Intelligence means knowing
how to adapt if conditions change

129
00:06:13,126 --> 00:06:15,486
or how to react
to an unexpected situation."

130
00:06:15,806 --> 00:06:18,846
All of this is done by using
a strategy typical of living beings

131
00:06:18,886 --> 00:06:21,806
that combines emotion,
motivation and creativity.

132
00:06:21,886 --> 00:06:24,886
What is strong and specific
about biological intelligence,

133
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:27,126
which artificial intelligence
does not have,

134
00:06:27,206 --> 00:06:30,526
is the complementarity
of these emotional and logical aspects.

135
00:06:30,566 --> 00:06:32,526
Yes. Common sense.

136
00:06:32,566 --> 00:06:33,566
If you like.

137
00:06:33,846 --> 00:06:36,566
Avoiding the illusions
of general intelligence,

138
00:06:36,606 --> 00:06:38,206
which is far from the case,

139
00:06:38,286 --> 00:06:42,086
it would be better to speak
of artificial intelligence in the plural.

140
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:45,126
All the artificial intelligences
we encounter in real life

141
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:48,366
are just very technical and specific.

142
00:06:48,566 --> 00:06:50,166
They can only do the task

143
00:06:50,206 --> 00:06:52,646
they have been programmed
or configured for.

144
00:06:53,086 --> 00:06:55,366
A program
that beats the world chess champion

145
00:06:55,446 --> 00:06:57,246
cannot recognise a duck.

146
00:06:57,606 --> 00:07:00,366
However, when it comes to a specific task,

147
00:07:01,086 --> 00:07:05,206
they are highly efficient
and often better than us.

148
00:07:07,726 --> 00:07:09,526
From the lab to our homes.

149
00:07:11,126 --> 00:07:13,086
In recent years, artificial intelligence

150
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:16,046
has once again entered a phase
of exponential development.

151
00:07:16,086 --> 00:07:18,686
This is thanks to the increase
in available data,

152
00:07:18,726 --> 00:07:20,646
the processing power of computers,

153
00:07:20,686 --> 00:07:23,726
and the optimisation
of algorithms, of course.

154
00:07:24,046 --> 00:07:27,886
Voice or image recognition
or translation programs,

155
00:07:27,926 --> 00:07:30,286
which were scoffed at a few years ago,

156
00:07:30,326 --> 00:07:33,366
now work in a way that can be astonishing

157
00:07:33,406 --> 00:07:35,806
thanks to machine learning.

158
00:07:36,486 --> 00:07:39,046
Artificial intelligence has emerged
from laboratories

159
00:07:39,086 --> 00:07:42,166
and is now permeating
and impacting all areas of society,

160
00:07:42,206 --> 00:07:44,006
from finance to agriculture,

161
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:47,166
from medicine to education,
and even into our homes.

162
00:07:47,646 --> 00:07:49,326
In today's digital world,

163
00:07:49,366 --> 00:07:52,166
we unknowingly encounter
and use artificial intelligence

164
00:07:52,206 --> 00:07:54,766
in our everyday objects,

165
00:07:54,806 --> 00:07:58,406
cameras,
recommendation systems on social networks,

166
00:07:58,446 --> 00:07:59,686
and connected speakers.

167
00:07:59,926 --> 00:08:01,686
A world of algorithms.

168
00:08:01,726 --> 00:08:04,486
Humans must decide

169
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:07,566
what the systems can do for us,
not the other way around.

170
00:08:07,926 --> 00:08:11,166
As these technologies
profoundly shape our society,

171
00:08:11,206 --> 00:08:14,406
understanding how they work is crucial.
