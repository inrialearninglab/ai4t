1
00:00:09,082 --> 00:00:12,246
The objective of this training
in the European context

2
00:00:12,645 --> 00:00:15,809
is to finally approach things
at three levels.

3
00:00:18,008 --> 00:00:22,500
Demystify and understand
what AI can bring to education.

4
00:00:23,661 --> 00:00:26,016
To experiment and use resources

5
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:30,494
that include AI
in an intelligent way, funnily enough.

6
00:00:31,966 --> 00:00:35,270
And lastly,
to develop the necessary digital skills

7
00:00:35,295 --> 00:00:40,887
among all educators and students today,
and AI is part of that.

8
00:00:41,686 --> 00:00:46,126
At any rate, a good understanding
of how AI is used is part of it,

9
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:48,589
in order to integrate
the ethical dimension

10
00:00:48,614 --> 00:00:50,989
into the projects from the start.

11
00:00:51,806 --> 00:00:54,886
In other words, what is AI for?

12
00:00:55,642 --> 00:00:59,486
What is the challenge
and the expected result of AI?

13
00:01:00,478 --> 00:01:04,281
How can we implement
and use these AI resources?

14
00:01:05,141 --> 00:01:08,634
Finally,
how can we also integrate questions

15
00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:11,274
that can introduce ethical reflection

16
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:14,892
beyond the regulatory issues
from the start?

17
00:01:15,947 --> 00:01:18,744
This is why
we chose to try to approach this AI

18
00:01:18,769 --> 00:01:22,795
in education from an age group
of 15-16 years old

19
00:01:23,054 --> 00:01:25,264
with students at the beginning
of high school

20
00:01:25,353 --> 00:01:27,975
for mathematics and science
on the one hand,

21
00:01:28,361 --> 00:01:31,006
and learning foreign languages
on the other hand,

22
00:01:31,629 --> 00:01:34,532
because we needed two experimental fields,

23
00:01:34,882 --> 00:01:37,063
two experimental domains,

24
00:01:37,366 --> 00:01:41,446
which would be feasible
over the duration of the project.
