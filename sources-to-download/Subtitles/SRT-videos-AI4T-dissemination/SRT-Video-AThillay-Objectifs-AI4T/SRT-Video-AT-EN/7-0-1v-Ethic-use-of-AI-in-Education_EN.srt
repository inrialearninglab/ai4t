1
00:00:08,366 --> 00:00:11,886
To face the challenges
in the European context,

2
00:00:11,926 --> 00:00:17,725
with the help of a guide to use
AI and data in education ethically,

3
00:00:17,975 --> 00:00:20,806
which the European Commission produced,

4
00:00:20,966 --> 00:00:23,486
there are different levels.

5
00:00:27,951 --> 00:00:32,191
Of course, the first challenge
in a European context

6
00:00:32,216 --> 00:00:36,486
is to be able to address
different education systems.

7
00:00:36,526 --> 00:00:40,283
It is to be able to address
different training systems,

8
00:00:40,308 --> 00:00:43,449
even though
we all have the same questions.

9
00:00:44,016 --> 00:00:51,033
So, in this European context,
we need to face this challenge and do it

10
00:00:51,058 --> 00:00:55,216
through identical questions
and solutions which can be the same

11
00:00:55,241 --> 00:00:58,920
while considering
a whole range of variations

12
00:00:58,945 --> 00:01:03,425
between countries, regions
and in my local system.

13
00:01:05,007 --> 00:01:08,655
From the local
to the national and the European,

14
00:01:08,734 --> 00:01:12,351
the first challenge we must face
is to identify

15
00:01:12,376 --> 00:01:16,675
the problems to be solved
and the solutions to be proposed together,

16
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:20,751
while still leaving room for adaptation
to each Member State.

17
00:01:21,357 --> 00:01:24,430
Of course, depending on
the Member States' priorities,

18
00:01:24,923 --> 00:01:28,274
we must provide added value
on a European scale

19
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:31,138
as per each one's competences.

20
00:01:35,246 --> 00:01:40,238
The second challenge is to have
an ethical and reasoned approach

21
00:01:40,263 --> 00:01:43,470
that invites us to experiment and identify

22
00:01:43,495 --> 00:01:45,759
the use cases in which this AI

23
00:01:45,784 --> 00:01:48,744
and these data to be mobilised are relevant

24
00:01:48,769 --> 00:01:52,767
to achieve an objective
that we have set ourselves,

25
00:01:53,199 --> 00:01:58,433
whether it's a learning objective
or a learning path objective.

26
00:02:00,006 --> 00:02:04,599
In the end, to identify this, it is about using AI

27
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:09,553
to adapt the solutions we can provide
to the needs of each student,

28
00:02:09,578 --> 00:02:11,952
to work on the rhythms,

29
00:02:11,984 --> 00:02:13,226
to work on the paths

30
00:02:13,251 --> 00:02:15,931
they may take throughout their schooling,

31
00:02:16,828 --> 00:02:19,628
but also to provide in other cases,

32
00:02:20,105 --> 00:02:23,269
such as that of pupils
with special needs,

33
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:27,681
adapted solutions
which effectively allow us

34
00:02:27,706 --> 00:02:29,050
to serve the learner

35
00:02:29,075 --> 00:02:30,582
and the teacher.

36
00:02:31,966 --> 00:02:34,489
This is really very important.

37
00:02:34,778 --> 00:02:39,391
This challenge must also be combined
with feedback on what we are doing

38
00:02:39,452 --> 00:02:44,579
and an important link with research
in education and digital education,

39
00:02:44,604 --> 00:02:47,291
which is also one of the challenges,

40
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:49,689
in other words, to be accompanied

41
00:02:49,714 --> 00:02:53,143
as much as possible
and not to remain alone.

42
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:57,701
We must never be left alone.
We must work as a team.

43
00:02:58,198 --> 00:03:01,206
This is essential
for this second challenge,

44
00:03:01,246 --> 00:03:04,406
for an effective ethical
and reasoned approach

45
00:03:04,766 --> 00:03:07,971
to serve and benefit the pupils' learning.

46
00:03:11,766 --> 00:03:14,901
There is also a third challenge
to be faced:

47
00:03:15,243 --> 00:03:17,606
the challenge of novelty.

48
00:03:17,646 --> 00:03:21,100
Since AI and data in education,

49
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:25,053
including in relation to
the traditional digital technology

50
00:03:25,078 --> 00:03:26,764
that teachers can use,

51
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:31,750
introduce a complex and evolving systemic nature.

52
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,246
Actually,
the data that we propose as input

53
00:03:36,271 --> 00:03:39,793
for an analysis of what is done
on the learning traces,

54
00:03:40,455 --> 00:03:44,813
in particular,
if we take the case of adaptive learning

55
00:03:44,838 --> 00:03:46,377
for example.

56
00:03:47,886 --> 00:03:52,875
This means being able to consider the help
that will be given to me,

57
00:03:54,006 --> 00:03:56,390
but which is not the help
that I could have had

58
00:03:56,415 --> 00:04:00,914
from a fixed input
for a fixed expected result.

59
00:04:03,206 --> 00:04:08,643
In other words, including in the exercise,
in a succession of exercises,

60
00:04:09,198 --> 00:04:12,268
I will probably have elements
that will give me

61
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:16,173
strong or weak signals
about what the student will learn.

62
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:20,680
This means that
in my professional practice,

63
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,782
in my professional development,

64
00:04:24,321 --> 00:04:27,001
I also have to get used to making good use

65
00:04:27,026 --> 00:04:29,821
of the analyses that AI can provide

66
00:04:29,846 --> 00:04:33,246
in data processing and numerous data,

67
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:39,139
sometimes over longer periods
than I can do it myself,

68
00:04:40,172 --> 00:04:42,445
so that I can calmly approach things

69
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:44,375
that I had not necessarily planned

70
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,219
and consequently also adapt myself.

71
00:04:49,703 --> 00:04:52,166
The professional culture of the teacher

72
00:04:52,206 --> 00:04:54,195
is also at stake here,

73
00:04:55,246 --> 00:04:57,570
but as in society as a whole,

74
00:04:57,595 --> 00:05:00,371
with increased use of AI techniques

75
00:05:00,396 --> 00:05:04,129
associated with
various digital tools and services.

76
00:05:05,809 --> 00:05:09,141
In summary,
we can say that if the challenges

77
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:12,626
are mainly pedagogical and didactic,

78
00:05:12,651 --> 00:05:15,650
especially
in the teacher-pupil relationship,

79
00:05:15,892 --> 00:05:19,274
they are also a little broader
since they re-examine,

80
00:05:19,299 --> 00:05:22,454
as always
with the use of digital technology,

81
00:05:22,806 --> 00:05:26,406
and provide an opportunity
to rethink what we learn,

82
00:05:26,446 --> 00:05:29,461
why we learn it and how we learn it.

83
00:05:31,071 --> 00:05:36,101
To be able to test,
experiment and open up new possibilities,

84
00:05:36,929 --> 00:05:39,310
thanks to a technique that enables

85
00:05:39,335 --> 00:05:42,926
large amounts of data to be used over time

86
00:05:42,966 --> 00:05:46,806
which are,
even when you are an excellent teacher,

87
00:05:46,853 --> 00:05:49,208
very useful when you use them as an aid

88
00:05:49,233 --> 00:05:52,614
and take full responsibility
for what you do.

89
00:05:53,806 --> 00:05:57,842
That means that the human relationship
is also essential here.

90
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:01,821
Of course, it is the teacher who decides,

91
00:06:01,884 --> 00:06:05,563
and not the machine in the end.
