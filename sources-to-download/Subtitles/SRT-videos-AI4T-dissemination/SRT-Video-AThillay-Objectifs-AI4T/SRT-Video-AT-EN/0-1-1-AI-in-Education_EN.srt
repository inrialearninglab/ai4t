1
00:00:08,166 --> 00:00:11,606
{\an8}Creating this course
in the European context

2
00:00:11,646 --> 00:00:14,566
{\an8}of artificial intelligence in education

3
00:00:14,606 --> 00:00:18,486
{\an8}actually came about
as a peer-to-peer learning activity

4
00:00:18,526 --> 00:00:24,206
{\an5}between different colleagues
from ministries in Slovenia as of 2019.

5
00:00:24,646 --> 00:00:26,966
I had the opportunity to present

6
00:00:27,006 --> 00:00:29,566
{\an5}the Artificial Intelligence
innovation partnership

7
00:00:29,646 --> 00:00:32,846
to learn French and maths for pupils

8
00:00:32,886 --> 00:00:36,006
{\an5}aged six to eight
that the French Ministry just launched.

9
00:00:36,046 --> 00:00:40,216
{\an5}It generated considerable interest
among all the participants.

10
00:00:40,446 --> 00:00:45,366
In 2019, AI was emerging in all sectors

11
00:00:45,406 --> 00:00:47,686
of activity and education too,

12
00:00:47,726 --> 00:00:51,366
{\an5}and there were many questions
about what to do.

13
00:00:52,206 --> 00:00:55,166
Therefore, together with Italy, Ireland,

14
00:00:55,206 --> 00:00:57,206
Luxembourg and Slovenia,

15
00:00:57,246 --> 00:01:02,646
{\an5}we decided to submit this project
under the Erasmus programme framework

16
00:01:02,686 --> 00:01:09,166
{\an5}to tackle these issues together
and not manage them country by country

17
00:01:09,206 --> 00:01:12,086
since we have different education systems.

18
00:01:12,726 --> 00:01:15,326
{\an5}The objective of this training
in the European context

19
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:20,326
{\an5}is to be able to approach things
at three levels.

20
00:01:21,406 --> 00:01:26,166
{\an5}Demystify and understand
what AI can bring to education.

21
00:01:27,086 --> 00:01:30,006
Experimenting and using resources

22
00:01:30,046 --> 00:01:33,926
{\an5}that include AI
in an intelligent way, funnily enough.

23
00:01:34,566 --> 00:01:38,086
{\an5}Finally,
to develop the necessary digital skills

24
00:01:38,126 --> 00:01:43,406
for all educators and students today,

25
00:01:43,446 --> 00:01:49,246
{\an5}or at least to understand
the use of AI is part of it,

26
00:01:49,286 --> 00:01:52,806
to integrate the ethical aspect

27
00:01:53,006 --> 00:01:55,126
into the projects from the start.

28
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:58,126
In other words, what is AI for?

29
00:01:58,566 --> 00:02:02,806
{\an5}What are the challenges
and expected results of AI?

30
00:02:03,326 --> 00:02:06,926
{\an5}How do we implement
and use these AI resources?

31
00:02:07,006 --> 00:02:09,646
Finally, how can we also integrate

32
00:02:09,686 --> 00:02:16,406
issues that may bring ethical reflection

33
00:02:16,846 --> 00:02:19,246
beyond regulatory matters from the outset?

34
00:02:19,286 --> 00:02:25,006
{\an5}That's why we chose
to try to approach this AI in education

35
00:02:25,086 --> 00:02:28,926
{\an5}starting from
an age group of 15, 16 years old

36
00:02:28,966 --> 00:02:33,246
{\an5}with pupils at the beginning
of high school for maths

37
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:35,166
{\an5}and science on the one hand,
and for the learning

38
00:02:35,206 --> 00:02:36,446
of modern languages on the other hand,

39
00:02:36,486 --> 00:02:38,886
{\an5}because we needed two fields
of experimentation,

40
00:02:38,926 --> 00:02:44,566
{\an5}two areas of experimentation
could be done for the project's duration.

41
00:02:44,646 --> 00:02:48,446
{\an5}The first level, "Demystifying
and understanding AI", aims both,

42
00:02:48,486 --> 00:02:51,366
{\an5}I would say, to reassure those
who are afraid,

43
00:02:51,406 --> 00:02:54,126
{\an5}and to calm down those
who are enthusiastic,

44
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:58,886
{\an5}so that finally
we can identify which AI techniques

45
00:02:58,926 --> 00:03:02,886
can provide solutions to the problems

46
00:03:02,926 --> 00:03:05,806
I am trying to solve,

47
00:03:05,846 --> 00:03:08,566
{\an5}and also to identify possible biases
from the start.

48
00:03:08,606 --> 00:03:12,846
It's all the issues that allow you to say,

49
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:18,606
"We need to be able to test AI algorithms

50
00:03:18,646 --> 00:03:20,766
{\an5}and AI techniques
associated with resources

51
00:03:20,806 --> 00:03:27,366
{\an5}within a framework of trust,
so that we can finally make a real attempt

52
00:03:27,406 --> 00:03:33,726
to measure what to do afterwards."

53
00:03:33,766 --> 00:03:39,086
It's not magical, nor is it frightening.

54
00:03:39,126 --> 00:03:42,846
{\an5}There is no need
to be afraid of these techniques.

55
00:03:42,886 --> 00:03:44,766
{\an5}You need to understand
the general principles.

56
00:03:45,246 --> 00:03:47,126
You don't need to be an expert,

57
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:48,446
but understand the general principles

58
00:03:48,486 --> 00:03:52,846
to make good use of these AI techniques

59
00:03:52,886 --> 00:03:57,206
{\an5}in assisting the teacher
with their teaching workload

60
00:03:57,246 --> 00:04:01,286
{\an5}or assisting the student
if they are learning independently,

61
00:04:01,326 --> 00:04:03,486
for example, with specific software.

62
00:04:03,566 --> 00:04:08,686
The second level of experimenting

63
00:04:08,726 --> 00:04:12,086
and testing AI-enabled resources

64
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:16,086
{\an5}is to get past your fears
or general enthusiasm,

65
00:04:16,126 --> 00:04:19,086
to be able to identify their needs

66
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:22,726
or define their goals clearly,

67
00:04:22,766 --> 00:04:25,886
and to test in a trusting environment.

68
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:32,046
{\an5}In particular, by carefully looking
at what was in line with the regulations,

69
00:04:32,086 --> 00:04:33,566
and the rules,

70
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:39,446
so that we can finally test for real.

71
00:04:39,486 --> 00:04:43,486
{\an5}We'd test the resources
in a framework of trust

72
00:04:43,526 --> 00:04:49,446
{\an5}and check with our colleagues,
ourselves or with the pupils

73
00:04:49,486 --> 00:04:52,966
what is relevant or not relevant.

74
00:04:53,006 --> 00:04:57,966
{\an5}In fact, it's a question of discovering
and measuring, if possible,

75
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:00,006
{\an5}also with research teams,
but everything depends.

76
00:05:00,046 --> 00:05:06,286
We just need to act with a level head,

77
00:05:06,326 --> 00:05:08,246
{\an5}having taken
all the necessary precautions,

78
00:05:08,286 --> 00:05:10,526
from the point of view, I'd say,

79
00:05:10,566 --> 00:05:12,886
of all that can be bias at the start,

80
00:05:12,926 --> 00:05:19,526
{\an5}and at the end,
and to be always in charge,

81
00:05:19,566 --> 00:05:22,006
{\an5}so to speak,
of what we do and how we trust.

82
00:05:22,046 --> 00:05:24,246
It also makes it possible for the teachers

83
00:05:24,286 --> 00:05:29,046
{\an5}to gain trust
and through feedback finally,

84
00:05:29,086 --> 00:05:35,366
{\an5}to demystify what AI techniques are
and to use them well,

85
00:05:35,406 --> 00:05:39,126
{\an5}to identify well which AI techniques,
what are their objectives

86
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:43,646
{\an5}and finally to be able to measure
if it is relevant or not

87
00:05:43,686 --> 00:05:48,486
{\an5}in my class context,
in the general context,

88
00:05:48,526 --> 00:05:51,886
{\an5}of what there is to do
in relation to the curricula

89
00:05:51,926 --> 00:05:57,086
{\an5}when I am with the students
I have in front of me.

90
00:05:57,526 --> 00:06:00,646
{\an5}The third level, in fact,
invites the teacher

91
00:06:00,686 --> 00:06:04,886
{\an5}not to remain focused
only on AI techniques

92
00:06:04,926 --> 00:06:10,166
{\an5}or on disciplinary learning
and the AI techniques they use,

93
00:06:10,206 --> 00:06:15,286
{\an5}but to be part of a more global discussion
with their colleagues,

94
00:06:15,326 --> 00:06:20,526
educational team, and their school team,

95
00:06:20,566 --> 00:06:25,526
{\an5}to be able to participate fully
in the student's academic pathway

96
00:06:25,566 --> 00:06:30,326
{\an5}and by integrating ethical issues
on the one hand,

97
00:06:30,366 --> 00:06:34,766
{\an5}but also by thinking
that this is part of digital literacy,

98
00:06:34,806 --> 00:06:40,526
{\an5}of the wider digital skills
that every educator,

99
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:45,766
{\an5}student and, more generally,
every individual must have

100
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:49,046
{\an5}in the current context
of the digital transition.
