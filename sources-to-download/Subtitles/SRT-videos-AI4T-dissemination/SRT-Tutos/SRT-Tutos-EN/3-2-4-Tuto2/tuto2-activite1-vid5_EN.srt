1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,215
Mastering data sets.

2
00:00:02,404 --> 00:00:05,984
Artificial intelligence can only recognise
what it has been taught.

3
00:00:06,118 --> 00:00:07,968
The data you train the programme with

4
00:00:07,993 --> 00:00:10,553
therefore has a strong influence
on the results.

5
00:00:10,578 --> 00:00:14,357
Mastering the data is a key element
in mastering this technology

6
00:00:14,382 --> 00:00:15,965
and the results you get from it.

7
00:00:16,105 --> 00:00:17,590
We must always be careful

8
00:00:17,615 --> 00:00:19,965
when looking at an AI program's results

9
00:00:20,082 --> 00:00:23,832
and ask ourselves
what data was used to train it.

10
00:00:24,006 --> 00:00:25,148
Deliberately or not,

11
00:00:25,173 --> 00:00:28,131
it may contain
mechanically reproduced biases

12
00:00:28,204 --> 00:00:30,231
that have significant consequences,

13
00:00:30,256 --> 00:00:33,465
for recruitment, for example,
or access to credit.
