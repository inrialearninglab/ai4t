00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,048
Algorithms and data.

2
00:00:02,256 --> 00:00:05,678
Today, when we talk
about AI or artificial intelligence,

3
00:00:05,703 --> 00:00:08,396
we are most often talking
about machine learning.

4
00:00:08,421 --> 00:00:10,546
Unlike previous algorithms,

5
00:00:10,571 --> 00:00:14,256
which were a step-by-step description
of how to perform an operation,

6
00:00:14,367 --> 00:00:15,967
rather like a recipe,

7
00:00:16,295 --> 00:00:19,359
machine learning consists
of training a programme

8
00:00:19,384 --> 00:00:21,453
to make predictions based on data.

9
00:00:22,536 --> 00:00:25,750
For example,
it is used to predict a user's likes

10
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:28,281
based on
what they have already liked or watched.

11
00:00:28,954 --> 00:00:29,937
Let's test it.
