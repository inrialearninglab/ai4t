1
00:00:00,718 --> 00:00:03,673
What if we play with the data
to trick the machine?

2
00:00:04,232 --> 00:00:07,023
The program will make predictions
based on the categories

3
00:00:07,048 --> 00:00:09,953
we have defined and the examples
we have shown to it.

4
00:00:10,406 --> 00:00:13,169
Once trained, it is possible to trick it.

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,333
For example,

6
00:00:14,358 --> 00:00:17,566
there are jewellery items
that can deceive facial recognition,

7
00:00:17,965 --> 00:00:19,810
and signs with patterns

8
00:00:19,835 --> 00:00:22,803
that can bypass
automatic surveillance videos.

9
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:24,920
However, as we have learned,

10
00:00:24,945 --> 00:00:27,428
we can also trick the machine
with our data.

11
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,268
For example, we can train a program
to recognise beautiful and ugly people,

12
00:00:32,293 --> 00:00:35,773
by showing only our face
as an example of beautiful people.

13
00:00:36,151 --> 00:00:38,970
Generally speaking,
all the subjective categories,

14
00:00:38,995 --> 00:00:41,966
such as cute, not cute,
stupid, intelligent,

15
00:00:41,991 --> 00:00:44,532
depend on the person
who prepares the data.

16
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:46,700
We can also train a program

17
00:00:46,733 --> 00:00:49,450
to recognise whether there are people
or not in the picture

18
00:00:49,475 --> 00:00:53,359
by putting all our examples of faces
in the no people category.

19
00:00:53,384 --> 00:00:55,921
This enables us to go incognito.

20
00:00:55,992 --> 00:00:59,406
We will now hijack the data
to create a biased program.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,320
How can we trick the machine
with our data?
