1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,381
Tricking the machine.

2
00:00:01,423 --> 00:00:02,664
As you have seen,

3
00:00:02,689 --> 00:00:05,109
data plays a key role in AI learning.

4
00:00:05,134 --> 00:00:06,960
We can easily mislead the machine.

5
00:00:06,985 --> 00:00:08,546
If you want to train AI,

6
00:00:08,571 --> 00:00:10,273
you need thousands of examples

7
00:00:10,298 --> 00:00:11,930
and you need to know what they are.

8
00:00:11,955 --> 00:00:14,321
Nowadays, we can easily find examples

9
00:00:14,346 --> 00:00:16,969
with labels to answer our AI problems.

10
00:00:17,019 --> 00:00:18,947
You can create your own dataset

11
00:00:18,972 --> 00:00:20,541
or use ready-made ones,

12
00:00:20,566 --> 00:00:22,024
but as you know by now,

13
00:00:22,049 --> 00:00:24,214
you have to be careful with such datasets

14
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:26,487
because you can easily get biased data

15
00:00:26,512 --> 00:00:28,606
if you don't ask the right questions

16
00:00:28,631 --> 00:00:30,707
or if you don't sort them properly.

17
00:00:30,732 --> 00:00:32,440
There are two types of bias,

18
00:00:32,527 --> 00:00:34,880
processing or statistical bias,

19
00:00:34,905 --> 00:00:37,286
those that have to do
with poor data preparation,

20
00:00:37,311 --> 00:00:39,662
and societal or cognitive bias,

21
00:00:39,753 --> 00:00:41,795
those that have to do with human bias,

22
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,403
gender issues for example.

23
00:00:43,574 --> 00:00:47,603
At the end of the day,
AI is human and what we put into it,

24
00:00:47,691 --> 00:00:50,429
with both good intentions and biases.
