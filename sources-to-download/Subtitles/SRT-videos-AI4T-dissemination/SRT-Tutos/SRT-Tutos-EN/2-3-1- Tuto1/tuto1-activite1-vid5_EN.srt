1
00:00:00,048 --> 00:00:01,631
It may be wrong!

2
00:00:01,673 --> 00:00:03,340
It's just a prediction.

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,906
Recognising things in different positions

4
00:00:05,931 --> 00:00:08,506
or contexts is called generalisation,

5
00:00:08,556 --> 00:00:09,806
and that's what you try to do

6
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,841
when you train a programme
to identify stuff.

7
00:00:12,872 --> 00:00:16,481
We are very good at generalising
because we are quite approximate.

8
00:00:16,506 --> 00:00:19,927
Our program is very powerful
because it is very accurate,

9
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:22,068
but it is not so good at generalising.

10
00:00:22,161 --> 00:00:24,423
However, if we train it correctly

11
00:00:24,465 --> 00:00:26,296
with thousands of different examples,

12
00:00:26,321 --> 00:00:29,590
it can become more precise
than a human being in certain cases.

13
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,226
Today, we have programs
that can read medical images

14
00:00:33,251 --> 00:00:35,840
more reliably than humans.
