1
00:00:00,131 --> 00:00:02,215
Impressive, but what is it for?

2
00:00:02,506 --> 00:00:03,631
Impressive, right?

3
00:00:03,673 --> 00:00:04,965
All right, we agree.

4
00:00:05,006 --> 00:00:07,298
The program doesn't see our categories,

5
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:10,506
but it associates the label we've chosen
with the examples we show it.

6
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,381
This ability to identify things
can be very useful,

7
00:00:13,423 --> 00:00:17,011
and AIs are becoming increasingly common
in our day-to-day lives.

8
00:00:17,043 --> 00:00:19,293
It can automatically translate text,

9
00:00:19,318 --> 00:00:21,173
communicate with voice assistants

10
00:00:21,215 --> 00:00:22,881
or improve medical diagnoses.

11
00:00:22,923 --> 00:00:25,423
Computer scientists are also using it

12
00:00:25,465 --> 00:00:26,965
to try to build autonomous cars,

13
00:00:27,073 --> 00:00:30,479
but many uses are still to be invented
for the world of tomorrow,

14
00:00:30,565 --> 00:00:32,401
which will be more beautiful, fairer,

15
00:00:32,426 --> 00:00:33,943
more sustainable and simpler.

16
00:00:33,975 --> 00:00:36,559
Helping people with reduced autonomy, 
for example,

17
00:00:36,584 --> 00:00:38,173
by developing applications

18
00:00:38,215 --> 00:00:40,631
that can describe their surroundings
by seeing us

19
00:00:40,673 --> 00:00:43,365
or enabling paralysed people
to write text.

20
00:00:43,432 --> 00:00:45,993
Making work easier and more interesting

21
00:00:46,018 --> 00:00:48,273
by automating certain repetitive tasks.

22
00:00:48,607 --> 00:00:50,076
Limiting global warming

23
00:00:50,101 --> 00:00:53,756
by allowing more accurate predictions
of the future.

24
00:00:54,048 --> 00:00:56,256
Now that we know what AI is,

25
00:00:56,298 --> 00:00:57,885
what else can we do with it?

26
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,620
What solutions can we invent
for the future?

27
00:01:00,979 --> 00:01:04,173
How can we use it
in our day-to-day lives to help us?
