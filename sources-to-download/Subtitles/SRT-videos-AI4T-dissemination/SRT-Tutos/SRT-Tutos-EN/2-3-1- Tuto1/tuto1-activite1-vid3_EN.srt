1
00:00:00,048 --> 00:00:02,506
We have just trained our first programme.

2
00:00:02,548 --> 00:00:03,548
Well done.

3
00:00:03,708 --> 00:00:06,511
As we saw,
there's actually nothing magical about it.

4
00:00:06,536 --> 00:00:08,389
First, we told it what we would show it,

5
00:00:08,414 --> 00:00:10,586
and then we showed it some example images.

6
00:00:10,633 --> 00:00:11,998
This is the learning phase.

7
00:00:12,023 --> 00:00:14,497
The programme being trained
is called a 'model'.

8
00:00:14,857 --> 00:00:18,065
It can now predict
which category an image belongs to.

9
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,798
Its prediction
is still a statistical approximation,

10
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,131
hence the percentage.

11
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,915
According to its calculation,
there is a greater chance

12
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:27,690
that this image belongs
to this category than another.

13
00:00:27,966 --> 00:00:29,590
But can it detect everything?

14
00:00:29,631 --> 00:00:32,173
If we teach it to recognise cats,

15
00:00:32,215 --> 00:00:34,423
could it identify lions or tigers?

16
00:00:34,465 --> 00:00:36,090
Can our programme be wrong?
