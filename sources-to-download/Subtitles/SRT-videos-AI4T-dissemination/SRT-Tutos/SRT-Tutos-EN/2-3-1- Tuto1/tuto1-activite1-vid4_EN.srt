1
00:00:00,173 --> 00:00:04,465
Our programme can only do
what it has been trained to do!

2
00:00:04,506 --> 00:00:07,256
The program can only recognise
what it has been shown.

3
00:00:07,298 --> 00:00:09,453
If we teach it to recognise cats or dogs,

4
00:00:09,478 --> 00:00:11,506
it won't be able to recognise lions,

5
00:00:11,548 --> 00:00:14,465
but it will be able to tell us
which categorie it is most like,

6
00:00:14,506 --> 00:00:15,590
in this case, cats.

7
00:00:16,131 --> 00:00:18,006
It's not more intelligent
than what we teach it.

8
00:00:18,048 --> 00:00:19,506
When we discover a new thing,

9
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:21,465
we don't know what it is at first,

10
00:00:21,506 --> 00:00:22,965
but once we have learned it,

11
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,039
we are able to recognise it
in different positions or contexts.

12
00:00:26,124 --> 00:00:27,742
Is it the same for our programme?

13
00:00:27,804 --> 00:00:29,749
If we teach it to recognise lions,

14
00:00:29,774 --> 00:00:32,715
will it be able
to recognise cuddly toy lions?
