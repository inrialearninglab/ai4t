Magic?

2
00:00:01,881 --> 00:00:06,335
The first step in making a program learn
to recognise images is to train it.

3
00:00:06,607 --> 00:00:09,940
This is what we call machine learning.

4
00:00:09,965 --> 00:00:12,552
We'll show examples
by telling it what it is.

5
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:15,465
Whether it's a picture of a cat or a dog,

6
00:00:15,506 --> 00:00:17,173
we'll show it thousands of examples

7
00:00:17,215 --> 00:00:18,506
of each thing we want it to recognise.

8
00:00:19,173 --> 00:00:21,340
At first, it will make many mistakes,

9
00:00:21,381 --> 00:00:23,256
but after seeing numerous examples,

10
00:00:23,298 --> 00:00:25,048
it will be able to identify
a picture of a cat

11
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:26,965
even in a photo it has never seen.

12
00:00:27,006 --> 00:00:29,548
Now we can train our own AI.
