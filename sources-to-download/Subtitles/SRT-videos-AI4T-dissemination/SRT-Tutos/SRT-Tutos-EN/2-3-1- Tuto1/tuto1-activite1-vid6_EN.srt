1
00:00:00,046 --> 00:00:02,006
What can we do with this program?

2
00:00:02,423 --> 00:00:05,798
Now that we have understood
how to train artificial intelligence,

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,173
we can teach it to do whatever we want.

4
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:10,881
Can I train a program
to tell the difference

5
00:00:10,923 --> 00:00:12,715
between my cup and my glass?

6
00:00:12,763 --> 00:00:15,097
Or between my closed hand
and my open hand?

7
00:00:15,423 --> 00:00:17,756
My blue shirt and a red t-shirt?

8
00:00:17,798 --> 00:00:21,465
You choose your two categories
and your ten examples for each.

9
00:00:21,715 --> 00:00:24,090
Make sure
your two categories are distinct.
