What is artificial intelligence?

2
00:00:03,381 --> 00:00:06,756
AI or artificial intelligence
is a set of computer tools

3
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:10,506
that mimic activities
previously performed only by humans.

4
00:00:10,548 --> 00:00:12,381
These are usually cognitive activities.

5
00:00:12,423 --> 00:00:16,604
For example, it recognises
what is in a picture or translates text.

6
00:00:16,643 --> 00:00:18,179
It is all around us.

7
00:00:18,215 --> 00:00:20,881
Our phones recognise faces in our photos,

8
00:00:20,923 --> 00:00:22,756
translation sites recognise the language

9
00:00:22,798 --> 00:00:24,256
we speak before we even tell them,

10
00:00:24,298 --> 00:00:27,756
social networks can recognise faces
in our pictures

11
00:00:27,798 --> 00:00:29,506
and add bunny ears to them,

12
00:00:29,548 --> 00:00:31,131
and we have voice assistants to talk to.

13
00:00:31,173 --> 00:00:32,131
How cool is that?

14
00:00:32,173 --> 00:00:33,715
Let's take a closer look.
