1
00:00:04,397 --> 00:00:06,150
So, are you a good

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,096
discriminating neural network?

3
00:00:08,096 --> 00:00:10,670
Each time the generated image is considered

4
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:12,559
as real by the discriminator network,

5
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,619
the generative network reinforces

6
00:00:14,619 --> 00:00:17,293
its parameters and progressively improves.

7
00:00:17,293 --> 00:00:19,230
Some elements of the image

8
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,920
can particularly betray a generative AI:

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,807
the background of the image,

10
00:00:23,807 --> 00:00:24,865
the teeth,

11
00:00:24,865 --> 00:00:27,645
the asymmetry of the face or eyes,

12
00:00:27,645 --> 00:00:30,000
unexpected blurred areas,

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,840
a hair a bit strange.

14
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,524
If you look carefully,

15
00:00:33,524 --> 00:00:35,565
the images generated by GANs

16
00:00:35,565 --> 00:00:37,392
are still recognizable,

17
00:00:37,392 --> 00:00:40,000
but these bugs may well be corrected

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,671
in the years to come and it will be

19
00:00:41,671 --> 00:00:44,000
increasingly difficult to distinguish them!

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,627
Want to try again?

21
00:00:45,627 --> 00:00:48,142
It's up to you!
