1
00:00:04,159 --> 00:00:06,160
This type of new neural network

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,603
raises many questions

3
00:00:07,603 --> 00:00:09,850
as these GANs exist for all media:

4
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:13,509
text, music, animated images or videos.

5
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:16,084
So, real or fake?

6
00:00:16,084 --> 00:00:17,930
It is becoming essential to learn

7
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:19,990
to recognize whether an image is real

8
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:21,281
or machine generated.

9
00:00:21,281 --> 00:00:22,969
But how long before the details

10
00:00:22,969 --> 00:00:24,460
are no longer visible?

11
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:26,670
Are all types of content affected

12
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,629
by these generative possibilities?

13
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:30,648
Who is the author of these images?

14
00:00:30,648 --> 00:00:32,770
The person who created the programme?

15
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:34,460
The programme that created images

16
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:35,703
that did not exist?

17
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:37,582
And if we don't know if it's real,

18
00:00:37,582 --> 00:00:40,309
is there an annihilation of fiction?
