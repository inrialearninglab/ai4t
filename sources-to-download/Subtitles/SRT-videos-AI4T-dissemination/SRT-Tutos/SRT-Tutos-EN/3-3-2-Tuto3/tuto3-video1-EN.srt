00:00:04,528 --> 00:00:07,349
To create images, artificial intelligence

2
00:00:07,349 --> 00:00:09,771
relies on very special Neural Networksâ€¦

3
00:00:09,771 --> 00:00:12,261
Generative Adversarial Networks,

4
00:00:12,261 --> 00:00:14,031
better known as GAN.

5
00:00:14,031 --> 00:00:16,670
The GAN is a kind of abracadabra brawler

6
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:18,055
for creating images.

7
00:00:18,055 --> 00:00:20,729
GAN consists of two neural networks

8
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:22,135
competing against each other:

9
00:00:22,135 --> 00:00:24,621
the generator, the discriminator.

10
00:00:24,621 --> 00:00:26,604
The two neural networks

11
00:00:26,604 --> 00:00:28,074
compete against each other

12
00:00:28,074 --> 00:00:30,111
and one tries to fool the other.

13
00:00:30,111 --> 00:00:33,000
The task for the generator is to generate

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,525
thousands and thousands of new images.

15
00:00:35,525 --> 00:00:37,830
For the discriminator, it is to know

16
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,194
whether the image is generated or not.

17
00:00:40,194 --> 00:00:42,920
And you, are you a good neural network?

18
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,703
Will you be able to flush out the AI?
