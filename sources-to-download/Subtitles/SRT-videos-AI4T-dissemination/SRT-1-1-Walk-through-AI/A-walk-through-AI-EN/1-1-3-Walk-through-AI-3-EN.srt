1
00:00:06,838 --> 00:00:08,821
There is a whole digital ecosystem

2
00:00:08,821 --> 00:00:10,260
that is being developed around

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,066
the teacher and the pupil.

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,179
The use of digital technology is widespread

5
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:17,524
through the most diverse types of devices:

6
00:00:17,524 --> 00:00:18,900
tablets, computers,

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,793
and, of course, wifi access.

8
00:00:21,395 --> 00:00:24,431
This digital environment provides access

9
00:00:24,431 --> 00:00:26,208
to information, learning environments,

10
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:28,140
workspaces, textbooks,

11
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,364
transcripts, school reports,

12
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,330
and many other information and tools.

13
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:34,265
In addition to all this,

14
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,539
there is also online educational content:

15
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:40,440
textbooks or possibly free content

16
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,851
such as open educational resources.

17
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,720
Of course, all these materials and resources

18
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,672
do not replace the richness

19
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:49,638
of the interactions between teacher

20
00:00:49,638 --> 00:00:52,205
and learner and between learners.

21
00:00:52,205 --> 00:00:53,479
Several things happen

22
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:54,892
on the other side of a platform,

23
00:00:54,892 --> 00:00:57,473
of a screen, but we only see the result.

24
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:59,736
Teachers are used to picking up

25
00:00:59,736 --> 00:01:01,058
a certain number of clues

26
00:01:01,058 --> 00:01:02,686
in a physical classroom

27
00:01:02,686 --> 00:01:04,802
but they are not all available

28
00:01:04,802 --> 00:01:05,944
in the same way

29
00:01:05,944 --> 00:01:07,953
when they go through digital tools.

30
00:01:07,953 --> 00:01:10,727
The clues that teachers are led to perceive

31
00:01:10,727 --> 00:01:13,031
in a real situation in a classroom

32
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:15,484
are notably those of engagement

33
00:01:15,484 --> 00:01:16,845
and motivation.

34
00:01:17,338 --> 00:01:18,191
For example,

35
00:01:18,191 --> 00:01:20,063
you can see if a pupil is asleep.

36
00:01:20,063 --> 00:01:21,848
When the noise level rises

37
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:23,932
you can tell that something is happening.

38
00:01:23,932 --> 00:01:25,680
When all heads are down

39
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,779
during an explanation

40
00:01:26,779 --> 00:01:28,343
of a concept on the blackboard,

41
00:01:28,343 --> 00:01:29,574
you can say

42
00:01:29,574 --> 00:01:31,429
that something unusual is happening.

43
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,480
Even though there are many,

44
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,720
many possible explanations,

45
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,944
being able to pick up on these clues

46
00:01:37,944 --> 00:01:40,566
or the lack of them is important.

47
00:01:40,566 --> 00:01:42,649
When the pupils are no longer

48
00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:43,931
in front of the teacher,

49
00:01:43,931 --> 00:01:46,061
how can you see that they are dropping out,

50
00:01:46,061 --> 00:01:48,778
that they are no longer able to follow,

51
00:01:48,778 --> 00:01:51,218
either because it is too complicated

52
00:01:51,218 --> 00:01:54,232
or the learning format is not adapted to them,

53
00:01:54,232 --> 00:01:57,028
or simply because they do not understand

54
00:01:57,028 --> 00:01:59,162
why they have to follow this course.

55
00:01:59,379 --> 00:02:01,859
It is particularly in these areas,

56
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:04,000
such as engagement or motivation,

57
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,598
that the exploitation of digital traces

58
00:02:06,598 --> 00:02:09,240
by AI technologies can help the teacher,

59
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,768
as well as the pupil.

60
00:02:11,276 --> 00:02:12,475
More generally,

61
00:02:12,475 --> 00:02:14,084
according to Gartnerâ€™s model,

62
00:02:14,084 --> 00:02:15,562
AI technologies,

63
00:02:15,562 --> 00:02:18,272
from the most basic to the most advanced,

64
00:02:18,272 --> 00:02:20,160
can help the teacher to describe

65
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,105
(what happened?),

66
00:02:21,105 --> 00:02:23,632
diagnose (why did it happen?),

67
00:02:23,632 --> 00:02:26,256
predict (what will happen?)

68
00:02:26,256 --> 00:02:27,720
or prescribe

69
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,658
(how to act according to the possible evolution?)

70
00:02:30,658 --> 00:02:33,589
a learning situation to better adapt it

71
00:02:33,589 --> 00:02:36,680
to a pupil or a group of pupils.
