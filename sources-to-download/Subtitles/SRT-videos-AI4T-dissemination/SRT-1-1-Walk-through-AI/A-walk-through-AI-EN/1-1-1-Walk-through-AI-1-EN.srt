1
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:10,536
Imagine this metaphor

2
00:00:10,536 --> 00:00:12,339
that depicts a narrow point of view

3
00:00:12,339 --> 00:00:14,469
for school as a place that offers courses

4
00:00:14,469 --> 00:00:15,919
that can be represented

5
00:00:15,944 --> 00:00:18,947
as well-defined “courses corridors”.

6
00:00:19,238 --> 00:00:21,974
These courses corridors have an entry point,

7
00:00:21,974 --> 00:00:22,964
which is the one through

8
00:00:22,964 --> 00:00:25,031
which we enter the formal education system,

9
00:00:25,031 --> 00:00:27,180
and they also have a more or less

10
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,458
distant objective,

11
00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:30,747
which is the one that allows our arrival,

12
00:00:30,747 --> 00:00:33,533
in the long term, to the professional world.

13
00:00:34,103 --> 00:00:35,747
These corridors are relatively

14
00:00:35,747 --> 00:00:38,424
well mapped out, clear, and well defined,

15
00:00:38,424 --> 00:00:40,000
and they are designed for pupils

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,704
who are ready to follow them.

17
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:44,360
Pupils are well aligned,

18
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,461
well seated in the starting blocks,

19
00:00:46,461 --> 00:00:48,199
and ready to start working

20
00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:51,135
and learning efficiently.

21
00:00:51,954 --> 00:00:54,420
We are all aware, and particularly

22
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,000
the actors in the formal education systems,

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,212
that for some pupils,

24
00:00:58,212 --> 00:01:00,974
each corridor is an obstacle course race

25
00:01:00,974 --> 00:01:03,545
with sometimes significant difficulties.

26
00:01:03,983 --> 00:01:06,084
Some pupils will drop out.

27
00:01:06,084 --> 00:01:09,457
Others, fortunately, will succeed.

28
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,112
But the reality

29
00:01:12,112 --> 00:01:15,340
is much more complex than that.

30
00:01:15,738 --> 00:01:17,440
When we look at the starting line,

31
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,727
we see pupils who are

32
00:01:18,727 --> 00:01:21,170
indeed well prepared, and ready to go.

33
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:22,502
There are others who,

34
00:01:22,502 --> 00:01:24,256
although they are ready to go,

35
00:01:24,256 --> 00:01:26,492
are not well equipped or trained:

36
00:01:26,492 --> 00:01:28,153
they do not have the right tools,

37
00:01:28,153 --> 00:01:30,538
they do not have the right concepts.

38
00:01:30,538 --> 00:01:32,130
They don’t have the right preparation

39
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:33,180
or the right environment

40
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,272
that will allow them to succeed.

41
00:01:35,272 --> 00:01:38,461
Others are there, ready to participate,

42
00:01:38,461 --> 00:01:39,797
but don’t fully understand

43
00:01:39,797 --> 00:01:41,547
what is expected of them,

44
00:01:41,547 --> 00:01:43,730
and are then faced with difficulties.

45
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:45,524
And then there are those who,

46
00:01:45,524 --> 00:01:47,616
from the start, either quickly give up,

47
00:01:47,616 --> 00:01:50,458
or are not really ready to start.

48
00:01:50,458 --> 00:01:52,797
Of course, each pupil will build

49
00:01:52,797 --> 00:01:54,968
his or her own learning path

50
00:01:54,968 --> 00:01:56,421
with the help of the teachers,

51
00:01:56,421 --> 00:01:58,222
and all paths are good.

52
00:01:58,753 --> 00:02:00,691
Whether they go through the sand dunes

53
00:02:00,691 --> 00:02:02,876
or stay in the well-marked corridors,

54
00:02:02,876 --> 00:02:04,622
whether they take other paths

55
00:02:04,622 --> 00:02:06,659
or whether they take a few breaks

56
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,391
to regain their strength and recover.

57
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:11,713
Depending on each individual preferences,

58
00:02:11,713 --> 00:02:14,174
these paths can be followed alone

59
00:02:14,174 --> 00:02:15,736
or supported by other pupils,

60
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:17,406
teachers or supervisors.

61
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:20,612
So, where, and how

62
00:02:20,612 --> 00:02:23,289
can artificial intelligence be used

63
00:02:23,289 --> 00:02:24,588
 to ensure that each pupil

64
00:02:24,588 --> 00:02:25,966
will follow the learning path

65
00:02:25,966 --> 00:02:28,422
that is best suited to their needs

66
00:02:28,422 --> 00:02:30,646
and this path will allow them to succeed?

67
00:02:31,224 --> 00:02:33,846
Why can’t we do as the motion tracking

68
00:02:33,846 --> 00:02:35,204
applications do?

69
00:02:35,204 --> 00:02:37,406
That means, providing better analysis,

70
00:02:37,406 --> 00:02:39,289
through artificial intelligence,

71
00:02:39,289 --> 00:02:41,048
of digital learning behaviors

72
00:02:41,048 --> 00:02:43,329
and moving towards greater

73
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:46,269
personalization of learning paths.
