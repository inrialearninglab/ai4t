1
00:00:09,283 --> 00:00:11,502
During the interaction with digital tools,

2
00:00:11,502 --> 00:00:12,773
the learners leave behind

3
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:14,735
many “digital traces”.

4
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:17,314
There are traces they leave without effort,

5
00:00:17,314 --> 00:00:19,589
for example, by accessing a service,

6
00:00:19,589 --> 00:00:20,471
or a server,

7
00:00:20,581 --> 00:00:22,076
they leave a trace of their connection

8
00:00:22,076 --> 00:00:23,089
to that service.

9
00:00:23,526 --> 00:00:25,984
There are also the traces left voluntarily

10
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:28,891
that demands some effort, by writing,

11
00:00:28,891 --> 00:00:31,431
leaving comments, or rating, for example.

12
00:00:31,947 --> 00:00:33,184
There are also the traces

13
00:00:33,184 --> 00:00:35,108
associated with performance

14
00:00:35,108 --> 00:00:37,180
and the results in activities

15
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,705
present in the digital learning environment.

16
00:00:40,634 --> 00:00:44,093
These whole sets of traces generate data

17
00:00:44,179 --> 00:00:45,826
that can be analysed

18
00:00:45,851 --> 00:00:48,483
by artificial intelligence technologies.

19
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:51,265
The question we can then ask ourselves is:

20
00:00:51,741 --> 00:00:53,370
How is it possible to analyse

21
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,707
this dataset of digital traces

22
00:00:55,707 --> 00:00:58,074
to help pupils during their learning

23
00:00:58,074 --> 00:01:00,492
and teachers in their pedagogy?

24
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:03,530
If we look at sports training, we can model

25
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:06,072
information about the activity duration,

26
00:01:06,072 --> 00:01:08,379
the sleep hours, or recovery hours.

27
00:01:08,379 --> 00:01:10,872
Other traces are much more precise

28
00:01:10,872 --> 00:01:12,381
and can capture the so-called

29
00:01:12,381 --> 00:01:14,083
biological signals,

30
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:16,701
including the athlete’s emotions.

31
00:01:17,514 --> 00:01:19,436
In this context of sport,

32
00:01:19,436 --> 00:01:21,723
the traces make it possible, for example,

33
00:01:21,723 --> 00:01:24,541
to finetune the athlete’s training routine

34
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:26,887
or to provide better shoes.

35
00:01:27,247 --> 00:01:30,702
What if we dare to imagine similar tools

36
00:01:30,702 --> 00:01:33,039
that rely on artificial intelligence

37
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:34,867
to analyse digital traces

38
00:01:34,867 --> 00:01:37,682
but in the educational context?

39
00:01:38,315 --> 00:01:39,779
We can provide the pupils

40
00:01:39,779 --> 00:01:42,229
with very powerful tools that will help them

41
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:43,749
to make a self-assessment about

42
00:01:43,749 --> 00:01:45,601
their current status in comparison

43
00:01:45,601 --> 00:01:48,127
to their objective competences and behavior,

44
00:01:48,127 --> 00:01:49,498
in relation to the mistakes

45
00:01:49,498 --> 00:01:50,462
they may have made,

46
00:01:50,462 --> 00:01:53,844
but also in relation to the achieved successes.

47
00:01:53,844 --> 00:01:56,125
It is also possible to provide them

48
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:57,901
with other useful information,

49
00:01:57,901 --> 00:01:59,672
using predictive models.

50
00:01:59,672 --> 00:02:01,353
We can, for instance,

51
00:02:01,353 --> 00:02:04,688
offer them additional personalized resources

52
00:02:04,688 --> 00:02:05,909
that will help them to enhance

53
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:07,109
their chances to succeed

54
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:08,216
on their learning path.

55
00:02:08,677 --> 00:02:11,286
From the teachers’ perspective, we can ask:

56
00:02:11,286 --> 00:02:13,523
How can the available learning traces

57
00:02:13,523 --> 00:02:15,301
be used to help teachers to adapt

58
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:18,000
their teaching strategies and pedagogy?

59
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,601
By using a tool such as a dashboard,

60
00:02:20,601 --> 00:02:22,820
the analysis and visualization

61
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,282
of students’ behavior can allow teachers

62
00:02:25,282 --> 00:02:28,212
to better understand the status of a pupil

63
00:02:28,212 --> 00:02:31,014
or a group of pupils at a given moment

64
00:02:31,014 --> 00:02:33,171
or over time and, eventually,

65
00:02:33,171 --> 00:02:34,980
to offer recommendations of actions

66
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,562
and resources to support teachers’ decision.

67
00:02:38,203 --> 00:02:39,804
These recommendations

68
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:42,291
can be associated with explanations

69
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:44,090
to enable teachers to decide

70
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:45,687
whether or not to exploit them.

71
00:02:46,234 --> 00:02:48,343
Finally, can all these insights

72
00:02:48,343 --> 00:02:50,289
provided by AI tools

73
00:02:50,289 --> 00:02:51,974
also enable the institution

74
00:02:51,974 --> 00:02:55,191
to organise itself better, to renew itself,

75
00:02:55,191 --> 00:02:57,620
and to no longer have these corridors

76
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,027
so well defined,

77
00:02:59,027 --> 00:03:01,272
but paths that are more undulating,

78
00:03:01,272 --> 00:03:03,205
a little more complex, and even,

79
00:03:03,205 --> 00:03:07,880
above all, much more personalised?
